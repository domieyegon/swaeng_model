Though Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel’s old alliance with Iran, the two countries continued to conduct business with America’s blessing.
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980’s, through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point.
Israel and Iran, two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment, shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change.
It was during Yitzhak Rabin’s government in the early 1990’s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict, owing to the changing strategic environment after America’s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, which produced a series of breathtaking achievements – the Madrid peace conference, the Oslo accords, Israel’s peace agreement with Jordan, a near-rapprochement with Syria, and Israel’s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar – was an increasingly isolated Iran’s worst nightmare.
It was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran, two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East, chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms.
The conflict was now between Israel, a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire, and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians.
More an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such, the Mullahs’ resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish, pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran’s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses.
In an Arab Middle East, Iran is the natural enemy; in an Islamic world, Iran is a potential leader.
Ironically, Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy, for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in Palestine, and the Shiite majority in Iraq.
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran, but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching.
As an anti-status quo power, Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel, but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order.
But Israel has every reason to be concerned, for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge – the core rationale of Israel’s own strategy of “nuclear ambiguity” – and would embolden its enemies throughout the region.
It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way.
A military attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is too dangerous, and its results uncertain.
And, however severe economic sanctions might be, they might not bring Iran to its knees.
Nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon.
However, being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational, and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism.
In the American-Iranian equation it was the US, not Iran, that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy.
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War, but was left out of the Madrid peace conference.
Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And, when US forces overran Saddam Hussein’s army in the spring of 2003, the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table, from the nuclear issue to Israel, from Hezbollah to Hamas.
The Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process.
But, neo-conservative haughtiness – “We don’t speak to evil” – ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran’s demarche.
Iran’s mood changed by the time America’s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift, but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse.
This would not be achieved, however, through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime, or by America’s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran’s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race.
Iran’s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures, which are far lower than those of its enemies, but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power.
There is no better way to undercut Iran’s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, accompanied by massive investments in human development, and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East, including Israel.
CAMBRIDGE – Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand, I find today’s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious.
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments’ latest “comprehensive package” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months?
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding.
Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt, is not sufficient to stabilize that country’s profound debt and growth problems.
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall, and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
Let’s begin with why the euro needs to fall.
Absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union, which can lead only through constitutional change, the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable.
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign (junk) bonds.
That may work in the short term, but if sovereign default risks materialize – as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely – the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized.
And, if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer – and political resistance runs high – the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation.
Either way, the threat of a profound financial crisis is high.
Given this, what arguments support the current value of the euro, or its further rise?
First, investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario, the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro.
But, while this scenario has a certain ring of truth, surely any breakup would be highly traumatic, with the euro diving before its rump form recovered.
Second, investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic, the consequences radiated so widely that, paradoxically, the dollar actually rose in value.
Although it may be difficult to connect the dots, it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere.
Perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks, many of which remain vulnerable, owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value.
Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies.
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors.
If foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro’s strength, the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee, just as private investors would, only in a faster and more concentrated way.
Fourth, investors may believe that, ultimately, US risks are just as large as Europe’s.
True, the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits.
Whereas the US Congress’s “supercommittee,” charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package, will likely come up with a proposal, it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year.
Moreover, investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of “quantitative easing,” which would further drive down the dollar.
Fifth, the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis.&#160; An exchange rate of $1.4:€1 is cheap for Germany’s export powerhouse, which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro.
For the eurozone’s southern periphery, however, today’s euro rate is very difficult to manage.
Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis, wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards, even as productivity has remained stagnant.
But, because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone’s north and south, one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range.
Finally, investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders’ latest plan will work, even though the last dozen plans have failed.
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time, but not for all of the countries anytime soon.
So, yes, there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro, despite its drawn-out crisis, has remained so firm against the dollar so far.
But don’t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead.
BUENOS AIRES – Desperate times bring desperate measures.
The latest package to cope with Greece’s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country’s debt burden.
In essence, this is a back-door debt restructuring: Europe’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts, thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default.
A recurrent characteristic of Europe’s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent.
Indeed, many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980’s.
Bolivia’s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt, an operation funded by international donors, is a classic example.
But the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case: Ecuador in 2008.
President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign (debt repudiation was part of his platform), and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch.
The reasons invoked by Correa (legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange) were beside the point.
The default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets, only to buy them back at a discount through the back door.
That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico, which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above – a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off “vulture” investors.
To speed things up, after the default was declared in December 2008, Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders, to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned.
With the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands, and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff, the operation was a success.
This episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks.
The first concerns the market response.
Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields, it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador’s behavior: Ecuador, an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices, could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange.
This is particularly notable, given that Ecuador’s was perhaps the first opportunistic default (triggered by unwillingness, rather than inability, to pay) in recent history.
The second lesson, and the one most pertinent to Europe now, concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario.
Indeed, almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount.
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a “credit event” in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices.
The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement (that is, that private bondholders take a real hit) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005.
In Uruguay, what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief; in Argentina, a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50%.
So the question arises: how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort?
If Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt, the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out.
Only the probability of a default – and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts – can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount.
But the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring.
In other words, a successful buyback is a preamble to default.
Can Greece, with the EFSF’s help, obtain debt relief while avoiding default?
Small purchases at current panic prices, vulture-fund style, are always possible, but they do not promise substantial debt relief.
Large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market, defeating the point of the whole operation.
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe, both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced.
But what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way, say, by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market?
Naturally, the spread would automatically converge to the threshold, but how much would be sold?
Would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders?
If the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount, the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal.
After all, by capping spreads, the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside – a good reason, perhaps, to make the facility a temporary offer.
By contrast, if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels, purchases will be more substantive, but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders.
A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22: to succeed in inducing a haircut, it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate.
Without Ecuador’s gimmicks, buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece’s debt overhang.
Atlanta &#45;&#45; The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza, where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea, air, or land. An entire population is being brutally punished.
This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel, with United States backing, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006.
The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers.
Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now, after internal strife, Hamas alone controls Gaza.  Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel, plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet.
Regardless of one’s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine, we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water, food, electricity, and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza, about one million of whom are refugees.
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area, causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children.
Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week, this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B’Tselem, the leading Israeli human rights organization: 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3.
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn't take part in the fighting, and 25 were under 18 years of age.
On a recent trip through the Middle East, I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis.
One of my visits was to Sderot, a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza.
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism, since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants.
Subsequently, I met with leaders of Hamas, both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus, Syria.
I made the same condemnation to them, and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period.
They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had refused.
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and also rejected.
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land.
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, which is approximately one-fourth (28.5%) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community.
Some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River, and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for “security.”
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions.
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people.
This holds promise of progress, but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis, Maryland, a retrogression has occurred in the process.
Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine, the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased, and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened.
It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations, but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly.
It is time for strong voices in Europe, the US, Israel, and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people. 
OSAKA – Yesterday’s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955.
For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system.
Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government.
The Japanese public, even now, remains uncertain about the DPJ’s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution, which lack solid funding.
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy
Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP.
For the last four years, the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net.
Moreover, the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling.
The LDP’s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party’s power nucleus had melted down.
Once in power, the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins, which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests.
Indeed, immediately after the election, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due.
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP.
So, without breaking the regular budget cycle, the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP, but will also be stuck with next year’s budget, which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced.
As a result, the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP’s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch.  It will also revise the supplementary budget as well.
But time is short, and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen.
To gain control of the mandarins, the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries’ top leadership, as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister.
Unfortunately, the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill, which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees.
The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unprepared to tame the mandarins, and so may be forced to rely on them.
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan’s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period.
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.
Indeed, full-fledged “society”-building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state.
As a result, the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged, and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well.
They will most likely succeed.
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP lawmakers checked the bills, and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet (parliament).
Since the LDP, recently with a coalition partner, controlled the Diet, the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins, centered in the LDP’s headquarters.
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.
Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan’s government polity.
The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins, partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers.
The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, owing partly to the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, especially think tanks, where independent policy expertise can be forged.
Moreover, perhaps in anticipation of a change in power, the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries’ top administrative positions.
And what of the LDP?
Having fallen from power, it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds.
Unable to pay off its constituencies, disintegration looms, for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support, but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a web of insiders across the country’s industrial sectors, occupational associations, and local communities.
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible.
The DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support, so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups.
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.
A major power shift in favor of “society” has taken place.
If the DPJ can break free of mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister, as it intends, Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role.
Yerevan – Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan’s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic.
Given the two countries’ long-strained relations, this visit would have been remarkable at any time.
But coming as it does only one month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation, it may offer real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased.
Of course, ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey.
But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns.
In the new context set by the war in Georgia, the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone.
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey’s geography and history.
Situated figuratively between modernity and tradition, secularism and Islam, and democracy and tyranny, Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West.
For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our path to Europe.
It is a NATO member, bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs.
It aspires to join the European Union, and would bring the EU to our three borders, even as we, too, aspire to join one day.
Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker.
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
This year, as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter, Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel.
Now, in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis, Turkey’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus.
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts.
But, in order to succeed, Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region’s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes.
If this pledge is adopted and respected, conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different, more tolerant context, marking a historic breakthrough to peace.
In fact, why not take the idea of such a pact one step further?
We in this region can, and I believe should, call for a non-aligned Caucasus, free of security blocs and adversarial alliances.
After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their attendant security challenges.
Our countries and peoples have, throughout history, lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided.
Today, we share a common vision of European integration, and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned.
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region’s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance.
But, at the end of the day, we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation.
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts.
Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world, and certainly not in this interconnected region.
In fact, real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations.
One is a lesson from history: Russia’s strategic interests here cannot be ignored.
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos.
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever.
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region.
Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest.
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia’s strategic role in the region.
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia’s real and imagined reliance on Russia.
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul’s visit to Yerevan, real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries’ closed border – the last in Europe.
Or, for a start, the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational.
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show.
President Gul’s visit does mark a watershed – either as a failure to make history, or as the beginning of a new era.
NEW YORK – Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.
Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past, the young people of Eastern Europe’s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured.
Yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera’s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past.
Other examples come to mind: the accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa, Romania’s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade’s fascist past, and the attacks on the alleged “Jewish monopoly of suffering” which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag.
Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long, you risk becoming a devil yourself.
A Bolshevik anticommunism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe.
In country after country, that Manichean mindset, with its oversimplifications and manipulations, was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power. 
Opportunism has had its share in this, of course.
In 1945, when the Red Army occupied Romania, the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members; in 1989, it had almost four million.
One day after Nicolae Ceausescu’s execution, most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades.
Residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel, both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge, as the totalitarian state did, but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society.
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communistnomenklatura, untouchable in their comfortable villas and retirements, must derive great pleasure from watching today’s witch hunts and manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes.
But the case of Kundera appears different – though no less disturbing.
In 1950, Kundera, then a 20-year-old Communist, reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met – a friend of his friend’s girlfriend.
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison.
Kundera’s name was contained in the investigating officer’s report, which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive.
The reclusive Kundera, who immigrated to Paris in 1975, has declared that “it never happened.”
Moreover, Czechoslovakia’s fearsome secret police, who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him.
Until more information is forthcoming, both from Kundera and from the authorities, the case will not be solved “beyond reasonable doubt.”
Butif it happened, the case calls for a deeper reflection.
As far as we know, Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated.
Indeed, his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950’s was the most brutal period of “proletarian dictatorship” in Eastern Europe – a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers, fierce opponents, and apathetic bystanders alike.
Moreover, Kundera’s case is hardly unique.
In 2006, the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass’s disclosed that, 60 years earlier, he was, as a teenager, a member of the Waffen-SS.
Similarly, a few years ago, the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had, in his youth, collaborated with the fascist police.
Daily life under totalitarianism, be it communist or fascist, was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding.
I don’t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.
Why not?
We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes, but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody, demagogical, and tyrannical Utopia – and of human weakness and vulnerability. We may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist’s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work. 
But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work’s merit, yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses?
An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists, while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police.
Shouldn’t that cleaner’s drudgery to support her family, children, and her own survival be taken equally into account?
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, nuanced rules toall the captives of that ordeal.
In order to understand that epoch, we have to know and carefully judge often ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances, never simplifying a multilayered daily reality for the sake of current political goals.
If nothing else, in order to forgive, we have to know what we are forgiving.
In Eastern Europe today, old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson.
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years, until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality.
LONDON – Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, has been calling for the creation of  a “League of Democracies.”
This new international group would possess a formidable military capacity, based partly on NATO and partly on a “new quadrilateral security partnership” in the Pacific between Australia, India, Japan, and the US.
Neither Russia nor China, of course, would be invited to join: indeed, McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8.
The League is necessary, argues McCain, because in matters vital to the US, such as fighting Islamic terrorism, humanitarian intervention, and spreading liberty, democracy, and free markets,  the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations (i.e., from Russia and China).
In other words, the League’s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs.
The most damning criticism of McCain’s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies.
This is not only dangerous, but incoherent.
Russia and China do not “threaten” the “free world” with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces, as they did during the Cold War.
Moreover, the world’s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur: it was France, after all, which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq.
Moreover, on issues like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and climate change, the US needs  Russian and Chinese help.
Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board.
(China must learn to behave “responsibly,” McCain declares with breath-taking condescension.)  In fact, Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the “war against terrorism.”
Finally, the idea is impracticable.
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination.
So we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain’s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible.
Yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition, to which Britain’s former prime minister, Tony Blair, often gave eloquent expression: democracies don’t fight each other, so if the whole world were democratic, wars would stop.
Presumably, McCain’s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant’s dream of perpetual peace  closer to realization by putting  pressure on non-democracies to change their ways, by force if necessary.
Leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Is it true that democracies never fight each other?
The affirmative answer  seems to depend on two separate claims.
The first is that democracies have, as a matter of historical record, never fought each other.
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries (India is a partial exception), mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots, since World War II.
Moroever, they are “our kind” of democracy – constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems, not “Islamic democracies” like Iran.
A reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that “prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other.”
The second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies.
But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity, or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy?
Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945, or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm?       
The world already has a peace-maintaining institution.
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together.
Members accept the obligation not  to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council.
The US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN.
But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior, including by the US.
By implicitly bypassing the UN, and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war.
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism.
It is called trade.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules.
It is full of faults, which need to be corrected.
But we don’t need a League of Democracies to do this.
By subjecting trade relations to embargoes, sanctions, and tests of democracy, environmental standards, and human rights, the League is likely to retard the growth of trade, and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up.
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies – in order to spread democracy!
This is the thrust of McCain’s message.
As he put it, the US was built for a purpose – to serve “eternal and universal principles.”
Its God-given task is to build an “enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom, security, prosperity, and hope.”
Noble rhetoric!
But if that is the League’s purpose – and I see no other – then it is a danger to peace.
This is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-existence with non-democracies is possible.
This is crazy and unhistorical.
It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe, which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience, to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image.
I am all for spreading Western-style democracy, but not at the cost of making the world more warlike.
Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective, and one to which all the world’s major powers can sign up.
REYKJAVIK – If African countries were to adopt only one policy to boost economic growth and improve macroeconomic stability, they should reduce the number of currencies in circulation across the continent as quickly as possible.
Doing so would most likely encourage trade, as happened in Europe with the arrival of the euro, and could help contain inflation – which is always good for growth – by imposing international discipline on monetary policy.
The African Union is now aiming at pooling all the continent’s currencies into a single currency by 2028.
In the meantime, several regional monetary unions are on the drawing board, in addition to the two monetary unions that already exist, onede jure and the otherde facto.
The premier and oldest of these unions is composed of the fourteen countries that belong to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which both use the CFA franc.
The second of these unions is composed of Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and now Zimbabwe, all of which use the South African rand.
Disregarding Zimbabwe, a recent and incomplete convert, the 18 countries of the two existing monetary unions have, as intended, benefited from lower inflation than much of the rest of Africa.
To see why, consider Nigeria.
Before independence, Nigeria’s legal tender was the British pound.
With the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959, the Nigerian pound was introduced.
Back then, one Nigerian pound was equivalent to one British pound.
This arrangement remained intact until 1973, when Nigeria adopted a new currency, the naira.
The exchange rate remained unchanged: one naira was equivalent to one British pound.
The naira was intended to bolster the country‘s independence by making it possible for the central bank to pursue its own monetary policy.
It was also a matter of national pride.
The thinking behind the new arrangement was that an independent and flexible monetary policy would serve the nation‘s interest better than a fixed exchange rate that tied the naira to the pound.
But the naira’s introduction quickly put an end to parity with the British pound.
Government expenditure exceeded federal revenue, despite rapidly rising foreign-exchange earnings from oil exports after 1970.
The federal government’s budget deficits were financed through foreign and domestic borrowing, and by printing money, which led to inflation and depreciation of the new currency.
Today, it costs 220 naira to buy one British pound, which implies 15% annual average depreciation since 1973.
This depreciation would perhaps be justifiable had Nigeria managed to use easy money to narrow the gap between ordinary Nigerians’ standard of living and that of people living in Britain.
But that did not happen.
The purchasing power of national income per person in Nigeria is now 50% lower relative to Britain than in 1980.
In view of this experience, Nigeria now plans to abolish the naira in favor of joining a monetary union with four or five other West African countries (The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and perhaps Liberia).
But that planned monetary union, until recently envisaged to be launched in 2009, has now been put on ice.
Why?
The smallest countries show no signs of fear of being swamped by Nigeria, by far the most populous country in the group (accounting for 155 million of the six countries’ 200 million people), especially as the new West African Central Bank is to be located in Accra, the capital of Ghana (24 million).
Others, though, may fear the dilution of their sovereignty when the new Central Bank of theWest African Monetary Zonetakes over some of the policymaking responsibilities of national central banks.
But that, of course, is the chief purpose of a monetary union.
When the West African Monetary Zone finally is established, the number of currencies in Africa will equal about half the number of countries.
And when the East African Community with its five members (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) re-emerges as scheduled, the number of currencies will be reduced by another four.
The belief that sovereign national currencies, by enabling independent and flexible monetary policies, are the best way to foster economic and social development – the vision of Nigeria’s post-colonial leaders – is gradually falling by the wayside.
Efficiency dictates the use of fewer and larger currencies (and foreign investors, understandably wary of weak and volatile currencies, demand it).
Indeed, the success of the European Union and of the euro since its launch in 1999 has made a strong impression in Africa.Currencies, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, are like democracies: the best way to preserve their integrity is to share them.
NEW YORK – The countries known collectively as the PIIGS – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain – are burdened with increasingly unsustainable levels of public and private debt.   Several of the worst-hit – Portugal, Ireland, and Greece – have seen their borrowing costs soar to record highs in recent weeks, even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising.
Greece is clearly insolvent.
Even with a draconian austerity package, totaling 10% of GDP, its public debt would rise to 160% of GDP.
Portugal – where growth has been stagnant for a decade – is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to public-sector insolvency.
In Ireland and Spain, transferring the banking system’s huge losses to the government’s balance sheet – on top of already-escalating public debt – will eventually lead to sovereign insolvency.
The official approach, Plan A, has been to pretend that these economies suffer a liquidity crunch, not a solvency problem, and that the provision of bailout loans – together with fiscal austerity and structural reforms – can restore debt sustainability and market access.
This “extend and pretend” or “lend and pray” approach is bound to fail, because, unfortunately, most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to extricate themselves from excessive debt are not feasible.
For example, the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt via inflation is unavailable to the PIIGS, because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket.
The only institution that can crank up the printing press – the European Central Bank – will never resort to monetization of fiscal deficits.
Nor can we expect rapid GDP growth to save these countries.
The PIIGS’ debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is next to impossible.
Moreover, whatever economic growth some of these countries might eventually register is contingent on enacting politically unpopular reforms that will work only in the long run – and at the cost of even more short-term pain.
To restore growth, these countries must also regain competitiveness by achieving a real depreciation of their currency, thus turning trade deficits into surpluses.
But a rising euro – pushed higher by excessively early monetary tightening by the ECB – implies more real appreciation, further undermining competitiveness.
The German solution to this conundrum – keeping wage growth below that of productivity, thereby reducing unit labor costs – took more than a decade to yield results.
If the PIIGS started that process today, the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth.
The last option – deflation of wages and prices – to reduce costs, achieve a real depreciation, and restore competitiveness is associated with ever-deepening recession.
The real depreciation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher, making them even more unsustainable.
Lowering private and public consumption in order to boost private savings, and implementing fiscal austerity to reduce private and public debts, aren’t options, either.
The private sector can spend less and save more, but this would entail an immediate cost known as Keynes’ paradox of thrift: declining economic output and rising debt as a share of GDP.
Recent studies by the IMF and others suggest that raising taxes, cutting subsidies, and reducing government spending – even inefficient spending – would stifle growth in the short term, exacerbating the underlying debt problem.
If the PIIGS can’t inflate, grow, devalue, or save their way out of their problems, Plan A is either failing or is bound to fail.
The only alternative is to shift quickly to Plan B – an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries’ governments, households, and banks.
This can happen in a number of ways.
One can carry out an orderly rescheduling of the PIIGS’ public debts without actually reducing the principal amount owed.
This means extending the maturity dates of debts and reducing the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently unsustainable market rates.
This solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of debt principal were reduced.
Policymakers should also consider innovations used to help debt-burdened developing countries in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
For example, bondholders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds, which offer payouts pegged to future economic growth.
In effect, these instruments turn creditors into shareholders in a country’s economy, entitling them to a portion of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden.
Reducing the face value of mortgages and providing the upside – in case home prices were to rise in the long run – to the creditor banks is another way to convert mortgage debt partly into shareholder equity.
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity, which would both avert a government takeover of banks and prevent socialization of bank losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis.
Europe cannot afford to continue throwing money at the problem and praying that growth and time will bring salvation.
No one will descend from the heavens, deus ex machina, to bail out the IMF or the EU.
The creditors and bondholders who lent the money in the first place must carry their share of the burden, for the sake of the PIIGS, the EU, and their own bottom lines.
The widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly, right back to the days of opiates and cocaine, up through bromides, barbiturates, and tranquilizers: all proved to be highly addictive drugs, but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so.
Now anti-depressants--global brands with household names--are the problem.
The past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions.
In England, prescriptions of anti-depressants now match Valium at its peak in 1979.
It is now clear that today's anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being.
The sometimes intolerable withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-depressants also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects: substantial weight gain, loss of libido, and mood changes, to name just the most common complaints.
Suspicions about such problems--especially about drug-induced suicidal behavior and sensitization to depression--have been rumbling for years, but searching scientific investigations have only just begun.
An important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom's drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings.
They will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug's use.
This may help, it but won't address the real issue: how could regulators have allowed this problem to recur after so much bitter experience, and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves?
On the Richter scale of drug disasters, the looming anti-depressant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11, where thalidomide rates a 10.
Time will tell, but the key point is this: the thalidomide disaster of the 1950's and 1960's happened because there was no independent control of drug safety, whereas the anti-depressant crisis has grown under theaegisof an elaborate, expensive, and global regulatory system.
The nub of the anti-depressant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm, but that they were allowed to do so when the precedents were so plain.
If and when this crisis is ever properly investigated, it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms, as expose questions about what medicine is and should be.
These underlying issues seem all the more important because the Internet has for several years been groaning with evidence of the crisis to come.
The explosive growth of the Internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering, presenting, and communicating evidence.
It broadened and deepened understanding of the problems associated with anti-depressants, giving patients a collective voice, as never before.
Previously, drug safety monitoring relied on occasional adverse reports from health professionals about patients' reaction to medicines.
But this crisis revealed these reports' fundamental inadequacies, such that users' experiences with drugs can never credibly be ignored again.
United by the Internet, many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-depressant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that bore little resemblance to the labels' warnings.
The impact of this user intelligence has been profound: in 2003, one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the incidence of withdrawal reactions from 0.2% to 25% (even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is "not habit forming" at all).
The anti-depressant crisis provides, for the first time, dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk.
To be sure, user reports are not "scientific" and most, individually, might seem naïve, confused, exaggerated, mistaken, and/or just plain self-absorbed.
Yet in this case they provided, collectively, more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials.
So, now the question is not so much the value of patients' reports, but the integrity of medical research and the state of science. "Just how tainted has clinical medicine become," asked an editorial in the British medical journalThe Lancet in 2002; the answer was "heavily and damagingly so."
The duplicity surrounding the marketing of anti-depressant drugs underscores just how corrupt the profession has become.
The crisis now unfolding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science, the relationship between risk and benefit, and the conflict between imperatives of trade and health.
But one feature above all others captures the underlying problem: the yawning gap between the words of patients who speak their minds and the terminology of producers, experts, and authorities who mince words.
The 1990's saw "depression" formally redefined as a serotonin-deficiency disease and the scourge of millions--a convenient and seductive view, but deeply simplistic.
The term "drug dependence" was also redefined, to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting.
The ubiquitous term "discontinuation symptoms"--Orwelliannewspeak for withdrawal--implied that anti-depressants carried no risk of dependence.
On the contrary, wishful thinking led experts to adduce "discontinuation symptoms" as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies.
Later, suicides became routinely described as "non-accidental overdoses," and the broad-spectrum term "emotional lability" came into vogue, despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and an outburst of tears.
By contrast, user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality, rather than promote images that suit the vested interests involved.
In the long run, the anti-depressant crisis thus may prove to be a blessing in disguise, but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve.
WASHINGTON, DC ­– America’s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months – political strength, that is – by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table.
If we are still making any progress at all, it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators.
Most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware (yes, a pro-business state), who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector.
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients: arguments that persuade, the ability to bring colleagues along, and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time.
On two fronts, Kaufman has – against long odds – actually managed to make substantial steps.
Long before it became fashionable, Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex, effectively at the heart of Wall Street.
This thesis is now gaining much broader traction – major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government – and by New York’s state attorney general – into the US financial sector’s residential lending and related securities practices.
With Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley, Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud.
More recently, Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony, evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman, was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington Mutual, Goldman, and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies.
Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading, which is little understood by America’s main financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and poses systemic market risk.
His concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6, when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function: price discovery between buyers and sellers.
We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms, interacting across more than 50 market centers, caused this catastrophe.
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind “financial innovation.”
Kaufman’s approach – with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature – seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago.
No significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns – preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology.
Now people get it.
As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged, “The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all... I’ve been proud to follow his lead.”
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency.
It fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership.
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs – trades by time and customer – to understand the actions and impact of large traders.
Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more – and do it much faster; to be sure, they and many others are now listening.
On a third issue, the results so far are mixed.
Kaufman championed the case for making America’s biggest banks smaller, as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts.
His advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an amendment, co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown, that would have imposed a hard cap on banks’ size and leverage (debt relative to assets).
The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable, yet it went down to defeat, 33-61, also on May 6.
It might have gained more support just a few days later – after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks.
Still, it has strengthened backing for another amendment, sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin, which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account – coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and “dark” part of high-speed trading.
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman’s critique of our system is the need for tough laws.
We cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing.
In particular, regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque, and when powerful Wall Street interests (and their Capitol Hill allies) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem.
Unfortunately, despite his newfound prominence on the national stage, Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year – he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden’s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election.
When he goes, dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.
Let’s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues – preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector.
Kaufman’s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident: relying on deregulation and self-interest in today’s complex, opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth.
We must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets.
ROME – US President Barack Obama’s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe.
Only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective, as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe’s division, can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings.
The crisis in Europe’s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences – for the region, for Europe, and for the world.
The Mediterranean region is vital to Europe’s peace, stability, and economic growth.
The continent’s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner.
And events there, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners – first and foremost the United States.
Current events, not just in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain, mirror the political complexity of these countries.
They also spring from different factors, such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption, coupled with demands for greater democratization, reduction of economic and social inequalities, and job creation.
Europe’s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition.
Proposals for some sort of “partnership for transformation,” based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, should bear in mind that the region’s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months.
No surprise, then, that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans.
Chaos, a resurgence of terrorism, the rise of radical Islamism, and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated.
Given this, the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region’s security.
Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe’s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability, the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs.
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia – and possibly a peaceful Libya – to strengthen their political stability through democratization.
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing.
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace.
The situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage.
The broad planks of a partnership are already there, so what is now needed is to enhance Europe’s integration with its southern neighbors.
This is why Italy has proposed a new EU “Plan for the Mediterranean” aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources.
The Union for the Mediterranean, launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services.
Let us, together with the US, tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies.
Let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU’s internal market and participate in EU programs.
To achieve all of this, a clear set of principles is required.
We Europeans must favor stability, create a real spirit of co-ownership, and promote political responsibility.In this new framework, the EU should avoid excessive conditionality, especially during the transition period.
Europe’s strong support for the region’s economic development must remain the top priority, as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms.
Moreover, a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task.
One proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank’s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), which would become an autonomous institution, perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa, with shares held by the region’s governments (or other institutions) and other willing parties.
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region, which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises.
The EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe; there’s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean.
At the same time, the EU must launch a “dialogue among equals” on political and security matters, aimed at confidence-building across the region.
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East (CSCM) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development.
In short, we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability.
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of “mare nostrum.e”
They are part of our collective history, and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build.
TOLEDO, SPAIN – This autumn, the Toledo International Centre for Peace convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East.
One conclusion that emerged was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional.
With this idea in mind, Munther Haddadin, a former Jordanian minister of water resources, proposed for the Middle East a “Water and Energy Union,” a long-term mechanism to integrate a fragmented region.
The idea is compelling.
Attending to such basic needs in a way that manages scarcities and surpluses regionally has a powerful logic.
Indeed, the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are clear enough that, over the past month, Joschka Fischer, Germany’s former foreign minister, has called for such a union.
So, too, have former Czech president Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water.
Having convened the meeting in Spain, we are very much in favor of the pursuit of such a worthy goal.
But the European “coal and steel union” became possible only after Europe’s major political conflicts were resolved.
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work.
All sides need to know where their borders begin and end.
And past injustices will need to be put aside, so that the cycle of revenge and the automatic reflex in favor of immediate gain do not scuttle regional solutions to problems.
Here, the experience of a previous regional exercise is worth acknowledging.
During the 1990’s, the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination concerning economic development, the environment, refugees, arms control, and water.
It failed, because when the bilateral talks collapsed, readiness to engage in regional cooperation withered under the despair of failed politics and the bloody reality of the Second Intifada.
The necessary political framework also needs to be regional and, fortunately, it exists.
The Arab Peace Initiative, first tabled at an Arab League Summit in Beirut in 2002 and reconfirmed in Riyadh in 2007, provides all the parties with a framework to resolve their differences, as well as a political basis for moving forward.
Adopting it is essential to moving forward, especially if additional chapters addressing regional security and economic relations are included.
Despite today’s chronic pessimism, the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union, coupled with adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative, would change mindsets.
Together, they would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework in which the region’s water and energy needs can be met; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal.
Moreover, the arid triangle formed by Israel, Palestine, and Jordan cannot meet its water needs unless yet another dimension is incorporated into the solution.
A World Bank report has already stated that, with 19 million people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean by 2020, water needs would not be met without making existing technologies of desalinization more economically viable.
Coincidentally, over the past month, there have been early signals of greater interest in a regional political approach.
The Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that includes Israel to resolve the problems ahead; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the United Kingdom to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace agreement; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has said that it may be time to pursue an overall peace deal for the region, accompanied by an economic package, since separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless.
Despite decades of effort, the process of trial and error through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration.
Whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the persistence of the occupation.
The problems are too complex, and the dangers of radicalism too advanced, to permit success through haphazard means.
The Middle East can end its state of permanent crisis only if it builds a comprehensive foundation for peace.
The Arab Peace Initiative, combined with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union, offers the necessary basis to meet the needs of the region’s peoples and mitigate future conflict.
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence.
It can be a herald of innovation on issues of common human concern – water, energy, and politics.
WARSAW – The eurozone is often considered an experiment – a monetary union without political unification.
Those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state, which possesses two relevant features: limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments and a substantial common budget from which regions hit by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers.
Those who claim that “political union” is necessary for the eurozone appear to focus on the second feature, despite the fact that fiscal constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important component of single states.
In this sense, they ignore the fact that the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact has been in principle an important component of political union, not its substitute.
Indeed, the eurozone’s current fiscal problems do not result from the lack of a large common budget, but from weak enforcement of the Pact.
More fundamentally, monetary unions – in a broader sense – have existed not only within single states, but also in groups of sovereign states, the gold standard being the most notable example in history.
The experience of such monetary unions offers two lessons.
First, they required fiscal discipline in the member states, which was true under the gold standard, with its informal norm of balanced budgets.
Second, they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center, because such a center did not exist.
Instead, a great deal of flexibility, including within their labor markets, facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks.
It is clear that there is no scope in the foreseeable future to extend the EU budget in order to increase fiscal transfers to eurozone members affected by sharp declines in consumption.
This would require an enhanced level of European identity, something which the Union’s political elites cannot generate artificially. &#160;But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve, but rather that it would not address the main problem: the weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states.
Instead of looking at the wrong model – that of a single state – the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions required for the proper functioning of a currency union that has no common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks.
First, utmost priority should be given to strengthening the mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks.
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of the accounting rules that define budget deficits and public debt, with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles, which cause deep recessions – and thus sharp increases in budget deficits – when they burst.
Likewise, the European Central Bank’s monetary policy should “lean against the wind” by paying more attention to the development of asset bubbles.
As the ECB’s common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all the member countries, the eurozone countries need macro-prudential regulations that aim at reducing excessive credit growth.
Meanwhile, the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced, which implies using and strengthening the available sanctions.
To be sure, initiatives at the EU and/or eurozone level cannot substitute for stronger mechanisms of discipline in the member states, which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and publics.
But EU-wide measures aimed at ensuring discipline are necessary to spur the growth of preventive mechanisms in the member states, and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries, which thus bear a special responsibility for the developments within the eurozone – and within the EU.
Second, beyond strengthening economic institutions, EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to boost their long-run growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks.
The former are necessary to help Union members grow out of their increased public debt, while the latter would help them to address unemployment.
Of the many necessary measures in this area, the most important include a vigorous effort to complete the Single Market, coupled with avoidance of economic nationalism at all costs.
Moreover, the Lisbon Agenda should be reinvigorated, with a focus on market reforms, and the EU should urgently reconsider measures – particularly regarding climate policy and the drift toward an EU-wide social policy – that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and/or hamper the flexibility of markets.
In this respect, the mode of fiscal reforms is fundamentally important.
As EU members already have large tax burdens, further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth.
Thus, fiscal reform should focus on reducing the growth of spending commitments, which –given the aging of EU societies – must include raising the retirement age.
Finally, rigid labor markets and, more generally, regulatory constraints on prices and on the supply response of the economy, deepen recessionary reactions to various shocks, and contribute to the growth of unemployment.
Therefore, labor-market liberalization should be a high priority and another area of focus for the reinvigorated Lisbon Agenda.
European elites are fond of exclamations about “European solidarity,” “social cohesion,” and the “European social model.”
But no amount of lofty rhetoric can substitute for the reforms outlined here – or obviate the need for them.
LONDON – There was a time when league tables were to be found only on the sports pages of newspapers.
Now they are a global obsession.
There are school and university league tables, rankings of companies on profitability or corporate social responsibility, tables of happiness indicators by country, and tables that attempt to rank consumer brands by value.
There is even a league table of the world’s funniest jokes (I did not laugh much).
The financial world is also full of such rankings.
Investment bankers wait with bated breath for the merger and acquisition league tables, even though the link between a high ranking and profitability is somewhere between loose and non-existent.
Bank league tables have been with us for a while, and now tend to be based on capital strength, rather than asset volume, which is an improvement of sorts, but still not very meaningful.
There are also now several different league tables – which are generating considerable angst – that rank financial centers based largely on surveys of firms.
How badly the financial crisis damaged the reputation and performance of the major Western centers is a question increasingly asked in London, and to a lesser extent in New York.
(Some Americans tend to think that the world will beat a path to their door, no matter how badly they are received when they arrive!)
So far, the message from the most recent tables is not too alarming for the incumbents.
A ranking prepared for the City Corporation in London shows New York and London still neck and neck at the top of the league.
The Banker magazine produces another, with New York on top and London a close second – though the distance between them and their pursuers is narrowing.
The scores in both London and New York for the quality and intensity of regulation, and the tax burden, have dropped.
Firms seem nervous about the future in both areas. 
The most striking change in the rankings is the rise of major Asian financial centers – and not just Hong Kong and Singapore, but also Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen.
The Chinese have been explicitly promoting their financial centers, and the impact is beginning to be seen.
The World Economic Forum’s Financial Development Index – yet another league table to consider – shows Hong Kong and Singapore very close indeed to London, with China now ahead of Italy on the overall measure of financial sophistication.
Noodles are beating spaghetti.
Some of this is unsurprising.
As the world’s center of economic gravity shifts east, the balance of financial activity is bound to move with it.
On the principle that if something is inevitable, it is wise to welcome it, the appropriate response in London and New York is to find ways of collaborating with these new centers.
But the more important question for the traditional financial centers is whether international activity that can move really is moving.
That is far harder to judge.
There are anecdotes about individual hedge-fund managers moving to Geneva.
Every time a government, or a regulator, announces some new control, or a tightening of existing controls, there are threats from bankers that they will pack up and leave town, taking their Porsches and mistresses with them. 
These threats, which used to have a lot of political impact, are now much less effective.
Some politicians and commentators quickly say, “Good riddance.” Even the Bank of England has asked whether, given the cost of mopping up the mess caused by the latest crisis, it is worth playing host to a global financial market.
This is risky speculation.
However badly bankers have behaved – and some clearly deserve a decade or more in the sin bin – financial services are a crucial element of London’s economy.
If the financial sector declines, what will replace it in employment terms?
Airy talk about science and manufacturing as ladders out of recession (a favorite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown) is just that – empty words.
There are few, if any, examples of high-cost post-industrial societies reviving their manufacturing sector on a large scale once it has declined.
London, in particular, has no inalienable right to be a global financial center.
The United Kingdom’s domestic market is, after all, much smaller than that of the United States.
Indeed, the location of financial activity has changed through the centuries.
If incumbency were a permanent advantage, Goldman Sachs’ global headquarters would be in Babylon.
There must be a tipping point at which some combination of higher taxation, more burdensome regulation, and a hostile political climate causes financial firms to relocate. 
There is a risk that Britain may now be approaching that point.
That is why the UK’s Financial Services Authority, and even the Confederation of British Industry, which speaks largely for non-financial firms concerned about access to credit, has begun to call for a truce between the authorities and financial markets.
The next two or three months will determine whether peace breaks out, and, if it does, whether it will endure.
As is always the case in peace negotiations, both sides must be willing to compromise.
Firms will need to show visible restraint when it comes to this year’s bonus round.
The British government will not tolerate another jamboree.
And governments on both sides of the Atlantic will need to decide just how far they want to go in punishing banks.
Continued threats of ever-higher tax burdens could prove dangerously counterproductive.
If we fail to settle on a new social contract between the state and the markets soon, those markets may indeed move elsewhere.
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin’s “dictatorship of law” has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia’s bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law.
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe. Germany’s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin’s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia’s economy.
The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense ofdéjà vu: just as in the KGB’s heyday, people simply disappear in Putin’s Russia.
Politkovskaya’s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.
The fact that Russia’s Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya’s killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn’t inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy.
In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia’s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
Politkovskaya’s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia’s President.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow,Novaya Gazeta, and in her books “Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy” and “A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya,” Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin’s presidency.
As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin’s enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.
I am not accusing Putin’s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.
After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin’s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.
Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her.
Putin’s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin’s “dictatorship of law” was anything more than a PR strategy.
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms.
On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These “neo-spies” include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin’s Kremlin cabal.
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule.
The danger for the world is that Putin’s lawlessness is being exported.
Across Russia’s near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
Look at Putin’s attempt to rig Ukraine’s previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin’s backing.
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maximqui tacet consenterevidetur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin’s construction of a lawless energy superpower.
NEW YORK – The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media.
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world.
Now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set: DVDs, computers, game boxes, smart phones, and more.
A growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects.
The United States led the world into the television age, and the implications can be seen most directly in America’s long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called “the glass teat.”
In 1950, fewer than 8% of American households owned a TV; by 1960, 90% had one.
That level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere, and the poorest countries are still not there.
True to form, Americans became the greatest TV watchers, which is probably still true today, even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete.
The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount, given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices.
Other countries log far fewer viewing hours.
In Scandinavia, for example, time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average.
The consequences for American society are profound, troubling, and a warning to the world – though it probably comes far too late to be heeded.
First, heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure.
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction, with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse.
Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do.
Moreover, heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation.
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen.
Robert Putnam, the leading scholar of America’s declining sense of community, has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “social capital,” the trust that binds communities together.
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago.
Of course, many other factors are at work, but television-driven social atomization should not be understated.
Certainly, heavy TV viewing is bad for one’s physical and mental health.
Americans lead the world in obesity, with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight.
Again, many factors underlie this, including a diet of cheap, unhealthy fried foods, but the sedentary time spent in front of the TV is an important influence as well.
At the same time, what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically.
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society.
America’s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands, and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising.
Effective advertising campaigns, appealing to unconscious urges – typically related to food, sex, and status – create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society.
The same, of course, has happened to politics.
American politicians are now brand names, packaged like breakfast cereal.
Anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle.
All roads to power in America lead through TV, and all access to TV depends on big money.
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before.
Even war can be rolled out as a new product.
The Bush administration promoted the premises of the Iraq war – Saddam Hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction –in the familiar colorful, fast-paced, and graphics-heavy style of television advertising.
Then the war itself began with the so-called “shock and awe” bombing of Baghdad – a made-for-TV live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the US-led invasion.
Many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction, consumerism, loss of social trust, and political propaganda.		
Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that TV viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development, and called on parents to keep children under two away from the TV and similar media.
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox, but one that is perfectly understandable.
Children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households, but are also more likely to have a television in their room.
When a commodity’s consumption falls as income rises, economists call it an “inferior” good.
To be sure, the mass media can be useful as a provider of information, education, entertainment, and even political awareness.
But too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid.
At the very least, we can minimize those dangers.
Successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising, especially to young children; non-commercial, publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC; and free (but limited) TV time for political campaigns.
Of course, the best defense is our own self-control.
We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading, talking with each other, and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust.
These are violent times.
Some believe that we are experiencing a new kind of conflict: “culture wars,” such as those between Sunni and Shiite Muslims or tribal groups in Africa and Asia, or indeed Islamists and Westerners.
However, the deeper reasons for some of these conflicts may well be more traditional.
Belonging to a particular cultural group is merely a pretext for battles between the winners and losers of globalization.
Ruthless leaders mobilize disoriented followers.
Particularly the losers, often represented by young men with no future to look forward to, can be induced to take even suicidal action against the alleged enemy.
Perhaps one should not be surprised that at such a time, the oldest of our ugly ­– indeed, deadly – resentments, anti-Semitism, is re-emerging from the shadows.
Its comeback takes the classical form of attacks on individuals, like the recent killing of a young Jew in France, or of disfiguring symbolic places, like cemeteries and synagogues.
But there is also a more general sense of hostility to all things Jewish.
One would have thought that anti-Semitism died forever with the Holocaust; but it did not.
There are those who deny that the Holocaust ever took place, or that it did in its all-too-well-documented manner.
The deniers range from second-rate historians like David Irving to apparently popular politicians like Iran’s recently elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The evidence of what Nazi Germany did is so powerful that those who deny it can probably be dealt with even without putting them in prison and thereby drawing more attention to them than they deserve.
The more worrisome source of anti-Semitism is different and justifies speaking of a new anti-Semitism.
It has to do with Israel.
To be sure, America is the first name in anti-Western resentment.
But its second name is Israel, the only successful modern country in the Middle East, which is also highly militarized, an occupying power, and ruthless in defense of its interests.
It is difficult to exaggerate the strange sentiment in the West which one might call Palestine romanticism.
Intellectuals like the late Edward Said gave voice to it, but it has many followers in the United States and Europe.
Palestine romanticism glorifies the Palestinians as the victims of Israel’s rule, points to the treatment of Israeli Palestinians as at best second-class citizens, and cites the many incidents of oppression in the occupied territories, including the effects of Israel’s “security fence.”
Implicitly or explicitly, people take the side of the victims, contribute by sending money to them, declare even suicide bombers legitimate, and move ever further away from support for and defense of Israel.
Of course, it is true that in theory one can oppose Israel’s policies without being anti-Semitic.
After all, there are enough critics of Israel’s policies among Israelis.
Yet the distinction has become more and more difficult to maintain.
Jews outside Israel feel that they have to defend – right or wrong – the country that, after all, is their ultimate hope of security.
This makes their friends hesitate to speak up for fear of being painted into not just an anti-Israel, but also an anti-Semitic corner.
The defensiveness of Jews and the uneasy silence of their friends mean that the stage of public debate is open for those who actually are anti-Semitic, though they confine themselves to anti-Israel language.
Anti-Semitism is disgusting in whatever form it arises.
This is true also for other kinds of group hatred, but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism unique, because it is an emotion complicit in the near annihilation of an entire people.
The new anti-Semitism, however, cannot be fought successfully by education and argument in the rest of the world alone.
It is linked to Israel.
If one belongs to a generation that regarded Israel as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century, and admired the way in which the country provided a proud home for the persecuted and downtrodden, one is particularly concerned that it may now be at risk.
SEOUL – The long-delayed meeting of North Korea’s ruling Worker’s Party is now underway, and comes at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community.
It is widely expected that Kim Jong-il’s third son, Kim Jong-eun, will be appointed to a key position and be publicly announced as his father’s successor.
There are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place, allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base.
Whatever happens, and whoever turns out to be the new leader, North Korea most likely faces an unstable future.
The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise as the system’s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront stark new challenges.
Moreover, responsibility for managing that potential instability extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang.
North Korea’s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important political event as the Worker’s Party conference, held for the first time in three decades, was abruptly postponed earlier in September.
One cause for the delay could be a schism within the ruling elite, a group that “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before.
Moreover, Kim’s health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess, further complicating matters.
“Enough is enough,” a mid-level North Korean government official recently uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding Kim Jong-eun’s likely succession.
Ordinary North Koreans, too, evidently seem to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il’s inheritance of power from his father, Kim Il-sung.
Moreover, there is no hope that any new leader, whoever it may be, will get any breathing space to establish unquestioned control, given the economy’s utter state of decay, as last year’s failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated.
The regime is under growing pressure from those at the bottom of North Korean society, and recognizes its own inability to handle the situation.
For example, for the first time, North Korea’s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error – the failure of the currency redenomination.
For the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea’s people and its rulers seems to be changing fundamentally.
One troubling aspect of this change is that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in order to suppress popular resistance.
And, at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic isolation, North Korea’s leaders, their confidence boosted by their possession of nuclear weapons, might try to distract their public through audacious, and possibly destructive, acts abroad.
The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of things to come.
Indeed, the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime’s internal weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture – the latter being the authorities’ fearful response to the former.
Unfortunately, however, most international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease.
Of course, in order to pressure North Korea’s government to give up its nuclear option, the current international economic sanctions, which target WMD-related products and luxury goods, probably should continue.
But, at the same time, the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform.
At a time of increased tension between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake.
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed.
If, say, North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior, it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund.
Western governments also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy.
Of course, any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes.
The international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing the regime’s will to reform.
In fact, following the recent currency fiasco, North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before.
Such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy, which has been to pressure North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform.
To be sure, North Korea’s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement.
Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered.
But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea’s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform.
We need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously.
On the contrary, it may be impossible to win North Korea’s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change.  
The past two decades have shown that “politically correct” decisions do not produce the “right” results, even in the long run.
As North Korea grooms a new leader, the world needs to groom a new policy for North Korea.
The United Nations is torn apart by internal tensions.
No sooner was the controversy over the creation of a Human Rights Council satisfactorily resolved than a new battle has erupted.
The United States is pressing for administrative reforms and threatening to cut off funding if the reforms are not forthcoming.
The Secretary General has submitted a reasonable reform plan, but a majority of UN member states, acting together as the so-called G-77, are balking, because they regard it as another step in reducing the authority of the General Assembly relative to the Security Council.
In particular, they object to the plan’s proposal to give increased powers and responsibilities to the Secretary General, whose selection is effectively in the hands of the Security Council’s five permanent members, which wield veto power.
Many UN members, believing that power within the UN has been shifting from the General Assembly, resist giving up what they regard as its last vestige: control over the budget through the work of the Assembly’s Fifth Committee.
In practice, the Fifth Committee has exercised the kind of micro-management over personnel and expenditure that ought to be exercised by the Secretary General if the UN is to operate effectively and to have a staff which is up to the challenges facing the organization.
This is the basis of America’s insistence on administrative reforms.
There is an urgent need to find a way out of this impasse.
Failure of the current proposal would mean an effective end to all efforts to reform the UN, with disastrous consequences for people across the world who depend on the aid provided by the UN Development Program, the security provided by the UN’s numerous peacekeeping operations, or the myriad other services rendered by UN agencies.
For example, failure of management reform would fuel demands by the US Congress to withhold America’s contributions to the UN budget – a policy that would greatly undermine America’s own interests, such as the planned expansion of the mission to stop genocide in Darfur.
The path to a satisfactory resolution is clear: give the General Assembly a greater role in the selection of the Secretary General so that members would be delegating powers to an authority of their own choosing.
This solution would not only permit the much-needed administrative reforms to be implemented; it would also bring clarity and transparency to a process that is in great need of improvement.
After all, the UN Charter provides that “the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.”
The original concept was that the two bodies would reach a consensus on a candidate.
In practice, however, the five permanent members now agree on a candidate, and their decision is rubber-stamped first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly.
Real discussions about a new Secretary General are currently being conducted in secrecy among the permanent five, adding to the frustration of other UN members, including large powers that have been seeking without success to enlarge the Security Council.
To achieve the reforms of the budget process that it wants, the US will need to lead the way in persuading the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in the process.
This might be done in several ways.
The Security Council might agree to recommend several candidates from which the General Assembly would select one.
Alternatively, the General Assembly might propose several candidates to the Security Council, from which the Council would choose one to refer back to the Assembly for approval.
Either way, the selection process would benefit from greater transparency.
For example, the General Assembly should hold public hearings in which candidates are interviewed, thereby greatly enhancing the stature of the candidate who is eventually selected.
Such proposals, if accepted, would help resolve the current dispute to everyone’s satisfaction.
Indeed, they could make the UN stronger than it has ever been.
A remarkable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists.
Earlier this year, the government suspended publication of the newspaperBing Dian Weekly, provoking unprecedented open protest, which received extensive media coverage worldwide.
Even more surprisingly, the government, under the pressure of public opinion, has allowedBing Dianto resume publication.
The editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief were sacked, but the open questioning of the legitimacy of the government’s authority to regulate journalism is bound to have a profound impact.
Foreign observers are prone to associate theBing Dianincident with other recent crackdowns on China’s mass media, and to conclude that Chinese journalism freedom is hopeless under the present autocratic regulation.
Undeniably, there has been no significant change in the government’s system of journalism’s regulation since China adopted its “open door” policy almost 30 years ago.
On the contrary, it has become more rigorous and covert.
But I still have faith that subtle changes are occurring.
A prerequisite of effective control of the media is that the controlled accept the controller’s ideology.
After 1949, the Communist Party cultivated a stable of “theoretical experts” and other ideological servants to write lengthy articles propagating “Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.”
But nowadays, such writers are hard to find, and their work is received by readers with mockery and sarcasm.
In fact, the Central Propaganda Department’s ideological control can be maintained only through internal notices and telephone calls, which are widely scorned.
More importantly, even the regulators themselves have ceased to believe in obsolete and rigid doctrines.
I recently met an official working for a provincial Department of Propaganda and was impressed by his bold and straightforward comments on current affairs.
In private conversation, one might even take him for a liberal – one of a new breed of young and well-educated propaganda officials with an increasingly higher threshold of political sensitivity.
For their part, producers of news have long since ceased to believe that news is propaganda.
I started my career with China Youth Dailyin 1979 and have experienced the whole process of China’s opening up and reformation.
Our generation of Chinese journalists broke from traditional Communist ideas about journalism by the mid-1980’s through extensive reading of Western journalism.
Younger journalists have thus been exposed to Western journalistic ideas from the very beginning.
Indeed, Western works are taught as “models for writing” to journalism students in China’s universities.
This is a crucial change, and it is the fundamental reason for an increasing number of genuine news items and commentaries in China’s media today.
Market pressure has also been important in pushing Chinese media to embrace change.
Contrary to foreign perceptions, only a handful of Chinese media – for example,People’s Daily, Guang Ming Daily, and theEconomic Daily – still live on government funds.China Central Television relies mainly on its advertising income, with only a symbolic fraction of its massive budget covered by the government.
Whether most media outlet can survive is thus solely dependent on their market success.
To be sure, political information remains rigorously controlled, which puts a premium on “harmless” recreational, entertainment, and sports information – the reporting of which is basically free.
This has resulted, in the short run, in an embrace of low journalistic standards.
But many metropolitan newspapers that once thrived on infotainment have seen their circulation fall in recent years.
Sooner or later, readers will start to buy newspapers that can truly inform them and give voice to their opinions.
In fact, it is these tabloids, responding to market pressure, that have started to take on responsibility as public watchdogs.
On many occasions in recent years, they have been the first to break sensitive news.
As a result, mainstream media are being marginalized, and the previously marginalized media are becoming mainstream.
Thus, even without any change in the current system of regulation, extensive coverage of disasters, judicial abuses, and citizens’ pursuit of their statutory rights, along with the questioning of policies from public perspectives, is now common.
For example, reporting by theSouth Metropolitan Daily led to the abolition of an outdated housing ordinance issued by the State Council.Cai Jing magazine’s continuous reporting on SARS enabled the Chinese public to learn the truth about this epidemic.
TheBing DianWeekly ofChina Youth Dailypublished an article by Taiwanese writer Long Yingtai on Taiwan’s democratic development.
Such progress is slow and full of frustrations, for it reflects the incremental evolution of the system.
But it is nonetheless real progress, indicating the growing influence of the Chinese media and pointing to China’s becoming a country of “free expression”.
According to an old Chinese saying, “a just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds scant support.” A “just cause” resides in people’s hearts.
Without the hearts of news producers – or, increasingly, of censors – the seemingly formidable edifice of journalistic regulation will, sooner or later, collapse like the Berlin Wall.
NEW YORK – Many poor, food-importing countries around the world have become desperate in recent months, as global prices of rice, wheat, and maize have doubled.
Hundreds of millions of poor people, who already spend a large share of their daily budget on food, are being pushed to the edge.
Food riots are mounting. 
But many poor countries can grow more food themselves, because their farmers are producing far below what is technologically possible.
In some cases, with appropriate government action, they could double or even triple food production in just a few years. 
The idea is basic and well known.
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields.
Poor peasants use their own seeds from the preceding season, lack fertilizer, depend on rain rather than irrigation, and have little if any mechanization beyond a traditional hoe.
Their farms are small, perhaps one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
Under traditional agricultural conditions, the yields of grain – rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, or millet – are usually around one ton per hectare, for one planting season per year.
For a farm family of five or six living on one hectare, this means extreme poverty, and for their country, it means reliance on expensive food imports, including food aid. 
The solution is to increase grain yields to at least two tons – and in some places to three or more tons – per hectare.
If water can be managed through irrigation, this could be combined with multi-cropping (multiple harvests per year) to produce a crop during the dry season.
Higher and more frequent yields mean less poverty in farm families, and lower food prices for cities.
The key to increasing yields is to ensure that even the poorest farmers have access to improved seed varieties (usually “hybrid” seeds created by scientific selection of seed varieties), chemical fertilizers, organic matter to replenish soil nutrients, and, where possible, small-scale irrigation methods, such as a pump to lift water from a nearby well.
There is nothing magic about this combination of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
It is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960’s.
The problem is that these improved inputs have bypassed the poorest farmers and the poorest countries.
When peasants lack their own saving accounts and collateral, they are unable to borrow from banks to buy seeds, fertilizer, and irrigation.
As a result, they grow food the traditional way, often earning little or nothing from their harvest, because it’s not even enough to keep their families alive.
History has shown that government action is required to help the poorest farmers escape the low-yield poverty trap.
If farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies, income can rise, and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral.
With a bit of temporary help, perhaps lasting around five years, farmers can build up enough wealth to obtain inputs on a market basis, either through direct purchases from savings or through bank loans.
Around the world, government-run agricultural banks in poor countries once not only financed inputs, but also provided agricultural advice and spread new seed technologies.
Of course, there were abuses, such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones, or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy.
And in many cases, government agricultural banks went bankrupt.
Still, the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid.
During the debt crisis of the 1980’s and 1990’s, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank forced dozens of poor food-importing countries to dismantle these state systems.
Poor farmers were told to fend for themselves, to let “market forces” provide for inputs.
This was a profound mistake: there were no such market forces. 
Poor farmers lost access to fertilizers and improved seed varieties.
They could not obtain bank financing.
To its credit, the World Bank recognized this mistake in a scathing internal evaluation of its long-standing agricultural policies last year.
The time has come to reestablish public financing systems that enable small farmers in the poorest countries, notably those farming on two hectares or less, to gain access to needed inputs of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
Malawi has done this for the past three seasons, and has doubled its food production as a result.
Other low-income countries should follow suit.
Importantly, the World Bank, under its new president, Robert Zoellick, has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach.
If the Bank provides grants to poor countries to help small peasant farmers gain access to improved inputs, then it will be possible for those countries to increase their food production in a short period of time.
Donor governments, including the oil-rich countries of the Middle East, should help finance the World Bank’s new efforts.
The world should set as a practical goal of doubling grain yields in low-income Africa and similar regions (such as Haiti) during the next five years.
That’s achievable if the World Bank, donor governments, and poor countries direct their attention to the urgent needs of the world’s poorest farmers.
Whatever happened to the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy?
Not only is the public almost entirely ignorant of the EU’s policy agenda for boosting competitiveness, economic growth, and employment, but this ignorance extends to many intellectuals, academics, CEO’s, and even some MP’s.
For example, in all of the debates on the EU’s constitutional treaty, neither its supporters nor its opponents have so much as mentioned the Lisbon Strategy.
It is little wonder, then, that Euroskepticism – in France, the Netherlands, and elsewhere – is on the rise.
Despite the success and popularity of programs like ERASMUS, citizens don’t perceive the EU’s contribution to superior education or training.
Indeed, the last Eurobarometer survey on the Lisbon Strategy found that the European public sees little relation between EU policies and economic competitiveness.
Of course, some laboratories receive EU grants, but without recognizing a specific European mission in research policies.
Europe is generally considered more a constraint than as a plan, more as an instrument than a vision nourished by a clear and credible idea.
The essential responsibility for this state of affairs lies with Europe’s ruling class and policymakers.
As a recent assessment by former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok pointed out, the EU’s member states generally have not made the Lisbon Strategy a high priority, and they balk at giving the EU the means to pursue more ambitious policies to offset this neglect.
It is difficult to ask citizens to be enthusiastic about aims that their leaders ignore.
At bottom, the problem is one of legitimacy.
The main targets – jobs, growth, and research – are considered legitimate from the standpoint of fairness when described in general terms.
But the concrete policies needed to realize this aim are not, since reforming the welfare state and labor markets means more competition, which scares many citizens.
Legitimacy is even more problematic regarding recognition, which implies a feeling of community and attachment.
When we are faced with conflicting choices – burden-sharing through taxation, the organization of the public sector, the status of public employees, etc. – the member states are considered to be the only bodies entitled to decide.
In short, when the EU brings subsidies, it receives congratulations; but when it pushes for unpopular reforms, it becomes the scapegoat for political, social, and economic failures.
From an economic point of view, the Lisbon Strategy’s aim is to transform Europe into a power able to compete on equal terms with the US today and the great Asian countries.
But this aim does not appear to be creating a European identity, as the euro has.
Within many states, “power” isn’t politically correct.
Above all, there is no linkage between national power and European power.
If we want Europe to be more legitimate, we must explain how to tie these two dimensions of power.
Aside from ignorance of the Lisbon Strategy among the public and inaction on long-term reforms among the member states, a second problem concerns the lack of acceptance of the virtues of competition – the most effective way to ensure quality, innovation, and low prices for consumers.
Competition also puts an end to rent seeking and protection of traditional corporate advantages.
Of course, we must limit the scope of competition: there is no reason, for example, to extend it to taxation.
Similarly, while competition will improve the quality of research and education, this does not imply reduced public funding, a lower priority for basic research, or the elimination of scholarships.
Perhaps most importantly, competition is a powerful means to restore democracy and modernize political institutions by compelling policymakers to ensure transparency and accountability.
Elites must give up their privileges, and regulations on corporate governance must limit collusion between managers and civil servants or politicians.
We must explain to citizens Europe’s contribution to public ethics, and the democratic virtues of fair competition in economic, political, and social life.
Consider one of the main purposes of the Lisbon Strategy: the organization of research and higher education.
It is impossible to change radically the way scholars and research workers are appointed in most member states, and to revise completely the criteria for funding of faculties and laboratories.
But the EU can overcome national impediments by developing exemplary universities and research centers that would be properly European, serving as an incentive to quality and reform at the national level.
Emulation through excellence is the motor of competitiveness.
A good place to start is an idea supported by French Socialist leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has proposed that 0.25% of Europe’s GDP be dedicated to research and used to create a European Agency for Research.
Moreover, Europe must build up tools for strategic analysis, assessment, and forecasting to provoke and nourish public debate.
Such think tanks at the European level must remain free and independent, but leaders must learn to pay attention to and integrate their recommendations into the policy-making process.
In many matters pertaining to the Lisbon Strategy, the EU cannot avoid member states’ concerns.
But as the states won’t be able to do everything alone and won’t renounce maintaining political control, we must be able to link the Union’s policies and those of specific states.
Otherwise, the Lisbon Strategy could merely empower an inefficient bureaucracy, rather than boosting the EU’s democratic legitimacy.
In short, the Lisbon Strategy could lead Europe to become a real power in the coming decades, or it could fuel further growth of Euroskepticism.
As former members of our countries' congresses we believe that it is time to create a North American Parliamentary Union (NAPU) to address the growing number of big issues that North America's national governments have pushed to the sidelines.
Both past and present have been burdened by thead hoc nature of relations among the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
A fairer, more prosperous future for all three countries demands that we take a bold step forward.
Despite US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's snide reference to ``Old Europe,'' North Americans can learn much from the European Union and European Parliament.
In the 1950's, most of Europe considered the idea of a Union with a single Parliament a pipe dream.
Today the EU elects its Parliament, shares a single currency, and controls a budget that emphasizes raising living standards within the less developed member countries.
Within the near future, the EU is likely to be 450 million people strong.
The combined population of the US, Mexico, and Canada is about 410 million people.
Yet North America has failed to match Europe in building the political structures necessary to focus the hemisphere on the problems of immigration, cross border security, labor rights, and environmental degradation; or in facilitating a more united approach to strong economic competition from Europe and Asia.
On the contrary, in the aftermath of the Iraq War, relations between the US and its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are at their lowest level in years.
Clearly, efforts to deepen North American political and economic integration will be an uphill battle.
In the near future, the US government will be focused on homeland security, Iraq, the slumping domestic economy, and the run-up to the 2004 presidential election.
Canada's government has been more willing to approach North American issues on a bilateral basis than in a tri-national context; furthermore, Canadians are preoccupied with the consequences and aftermath of SARS and mad cow disease, as well as anticipating a new government next year.
Mexico's President Vincente Fox will govern through 2006.
But his vision of a North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) encompassing elements of social and political fusion with his North American counterparts was sidetracked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and by his political rivals' recent successes at the polls.
Notwithstanding this, most Canadians and Mexicans believe that cooperation in North America will proceed regardless of who is in office in Ottawa, Washington, or Mexico City.
Not only are Canada and Mexico the US's first and second largest trading partners, but the three countries maintain a myriad of relationships--in business, tourism, and culture--that do not pass through their embassies or governments.
Good feelings abound.
US citizens register high approval ratings in Canada and Mexico: 90% and 70%, respectively.
In proposing the creation of NAPU, we envision a specific plan to create a larger market by fostering an alliance between the three economies.
In just a single decade, the EU managed to bring poorer, peripheral member states--Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland--from 50% to 90% of the EU average in per capita income, creating a bigger market for companies from wealthier northern countries, and stemming migration from poorer southern economies.
The EU invested upwards of $35 billion a year to assure the success of their Common Market integration.
North America has largely ignored the significance of ``common,'' preferring to focus on ``market.''
This blinded all three countries to the centrality of community.
We have failed to understand that a North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) that achieves its full potential cannot be accomplished on the cheap.
A regional political structure will maintain the focus on vital but difficult issues such as immigration.
NAFTA was conceived under the assumption that expanded trade would trickle down benefits to all in the three countries.
Regretfully, this corporate-driven NAFTA exacerbated the disparities and asymmetries between Mexico and its two richer northern neighbors.
Moreover, throughout NAFTA's lifetime income and wealth have been further concentrated within the elite sectors of US and Canadian society.
Immigration illustrates the cost of integration without convergence.
Demand for low-cost Mexican labor by US employers and the 10-1 wage gap between the two countries pushes 350,000 Mexicans to risk their lives every year for better paid jobs north of the border.
Without Mexican manpower, much of the work in the US simply would not get done.
The issue must be addressed, not ignored and criminalized.
NAPU would be the ideal forum in which to address this concern.
Everywhere nowadays, key decisions are made by a self-selected group of elites, often in non-transparent circumstances.
NAPU would allow for wider, more consistent participation in the consideration of issues now ignored in all three countries.
Inter-American issues can no longer be left subject to the whims and convenience of individual leaders.
The people of the US, Canada, and Mexico deserve better.
For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out.
Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and the average person was curious about how nature worked.
Not surprisingly, this region was globally respected.
In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed.
Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien, and was later made subservient to religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
Both regions were religiously governed (historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.
Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.
Since World War II, the United States has been the world’s undisputed leader in science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands, attracted by superior research universities and opportunities.
Until recently, more than half of all mathematics, science, and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born.
Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and government took advantage of this.
Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed.
Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have.
Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.
More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries.
Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research.
Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?
This is one unclaimed opportunity.
But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies.
The US has made profound missteps recently.
“Matters of faith” have been substituted for science across government, from the president down.
Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief.
Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to “values.”
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities.
Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years.
Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance.
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980’s.
Japan’s chief industrialist, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book calledTheJapan that Can Say No.
They outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership.
The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the “food chain” of military technologies was controlled by other nations.
The book’s title refers to Japan’s plan to “say no” to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies.
Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible.
For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining.
Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment.
Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities.
The effect has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas.
Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world.
There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East.
First, however, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage.
LONDON &#45;&#45; The recent meeting in the Vatican of the “Custodian of The Holy Places,” King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and Pope Benedict XVI was a seminal event, particularly as it comes at a time when radical Muslims are decrying the role of “crusaders” in Middle East politics.
It was also the clearest sign yet of a rising “Holy Alliance” among the world’s conservative leaders.
For the key audience for this meeting of Muslim king and Roman Catholic Pontiff was not their followers, but another conservative leader, President George W. Bush.
The first “Holy Alliance” was a creation of Austria’s Prince Metternich following the Napoleonic wars.
It was an attempt to preserve the peace (and the security of the relatively weak Austrian Empire) through a coalition of victors upholding shared values.
Metternich’s “Holy Alliance” was the one original political idea to emerge from Napoleon’s defeat.
Behind its exalted name lay an innovation of great diplomatic significance: the introduction of an element of calculated moral restraint into international relations.
The vested interests that the Alliance members – Austria, Prussia, and Russia – had in the survival of their domestic institutions led each to seek to avoid conflicts that, in the past, they would have pursued as a matter of course.
Metternich’s system worked through much of the nineteenth century, because it protected a genuine balance of power between countries that shared common values.
But what “common values” do King, Pope, and American President share?
That such a meeting took place is a sign that both Pope and King believed that there was something to achieve.
Indeed, Abdullah, who believes himself to be the paramount leader of the Muslim world, is the first Saudi king to initiate a meeting with a leader of the Christian faith.
The two men met, seemingly as equals, not to express the common values of conservatism, but to confirm and promote their authority to uphold traditional values.
Both agreed that reform must be slow, cautious and that it must never undermine established institutions, especially religion and the patriarchal family.
Abdullah sought the meeting because he believes that the world since 2001 has divided the fraternity of conservatives.
Until then, he and Bush shared a common worldview, emphasizing the importance of religion, the traditional family (as both countries understood it), social discipline, and the state’s role in supporting these institutions.
But Bush, following the terrorist attacks of 2001, turned his back on conservatism.  He sought to radically reinvent the Middle East, not only by overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, but also through his strident calls for democratization.
American radicalism, however, resulted in increasing tensions between religious communities in the Middle East, and the rise of radical Iran with its bid for regional hegemony.
Since 2001, Christian minorities have been targeted throughout the region, including even Lebanon’s Maronite Christian community.
And in Iraq, Sunni Muslims feel under siege from the country’s majority and now ruling Shia.
Here is where the Holy Alliance concept of moral restraint comes in.
Abdullah, perhaps earlier than most others, understood that some code of restraint was needed if the entire region was not to descend into a war of all against all.
Moreover, Abdullah understands that his wobbly regime will only be able to withstand the radical gales that are now blowing if it can forge the type of stability-seeking alliance that Metternich built.
The King, like Metternich and the Austrian Kaisers, understands de Tocqueville’s dictum that the most dangerous moment for a regime is when it starts to reform.
Having begun, ever so carefully, to politically open his country, the King knows that he needs regional peace and a lowering of Islamic holy rage.
The problem is that Abdullah cannot rely on his domestic conservative allies to give him the time that the Kingdom needs.
The Wahhabi religious establishment, the Saudi state’s hidden co-rulers, could very well obstruct Abdullah’s attempts at regional religious reconciliation.
Members of the religious police remain adamant that the country’s Christian guests must continue to live according to strict Wahhabi rules of behavior.
While the Wahhabis could yet be bribed again with oil money, the sect’s power-hungry judges eagerly await the next beheading, stoning, or lashing in Riyadh’s public square.
Thus, uniting the forces of status quo conservatism, even if some of those conservatives are Christian, is the only viable diplomatic strategy open to Saudi Arabia.
For conservative rulers usually fall when they fail to grasp their own vulnerability, especially when the revolutionary challenge is cloaked in conservative garb.
After all, few political systems can defend against those, like Saudi Arabia’s Islamic radicals, who claim that they can preserve the system and its religious values more effectively than the current rulers. 
Only an alliance of conservative leaders and powers (including a retreat by America from diplomatic radicalism), Abdullah believes, can restore some stability to the Middle East.
The award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the United Nations and to its Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is a cause for true celebration everywhere.
But celebrations should never become an excuse for complacency.
Yes, the UN has achieved much under Secretary General Annan's leadership.
But the idea of the United Nations as a uniter of nations remains, in many parts of the world and for many of the world's most complex problems, more an ideal still to be achieved than a living reality.
Some of the most powerful nations in the world still do not see fully cooperating with or participating in UN affairs as in their interest.
Beyond states, the world's many NGOs are growing fast and multiplying in their influence, but without formal rules to define their role in the international system.
Their real power, despite Secretary General Annan's efforts to create a dialogue with them, stands outside the UN framework.
Indeed, NGOs often assume tasks for which the current structure of the UN is unsuited or remains far too weak.
To assist them in their tasks, and to assure that the great global issues of the day are addressed in a forum that unites and does not divide, the UN needs to be strengthened in the fields in which NGO's are working so impressively.
Such strengthening can only be achieved by a fundamental reform of the UN's internal structure.
When the UN was founded in 1945, the primary objective was to prevent the outbreak of World War III.
So, at its foundation, only one powerful body was introduced, the Security Council on which the world's great military powers sat.
The agenda of the Security Council was and remains power, and meeting crises, mostly with military means.
So the window of opportunity to talk and compromise may be open only briefly, and, unfortunately, we have probably not seen the end of nuclear brinkmanship.
MOSCOW: As war in Chechnya winds down to a low level conflict, it is time to revisit the question of what the war was about and where it will lead.
The West reacted to the conflict as a revival of Russian imperialism, a sign that Russia's relations with the world may grow cold again.
Many Russians, including democratic reformers who do not fully support Russian policy, feel misunderstood.
When Russians speak of their national interests people see visions of a Soviet-style empire striking back.
Nonsense.
Except for a small number of fanatics and a few Slovophiles, Russians see no way back to the imperial past.
Nor do they want it, even if they could have it.
Today, no irredentist/nationalist movement has significant support in Russia; nothing like the 15-30% of the vote for radical nationalists found in France and Austria.
I think the Russians don't get much credit, even recognition, for the unprecedented equanimity with which they shrugged off centuries of imperial tradition.
One reason Russia accepted so peacefully the break-up of the Soviet Union was that many recognized that empire and democracy were incompatible.
What Russians seek is economic renewal that will pave the way for Russia to play a more important role in the life of Europe and the world.
This is not to say that there is no resentment about the way Russia is treated.
For a decade we experienced humiliation after humiliation: the loss of superpower status; vast and disorienting social problems; NATO's eastern expansion.
No one pays any attention to Russia: not over Yugoslavia; not over decisions concerning former soviet republics, where significant Russian populations reside.
The West often claimed to be helping; Russia made a show of gratitude.
But honestly speaking, nothing has been done that could not be explained by pure self interest.
Not that the West did not have a right to act in its self-interest.
But so does Russia.
For many people, including our educated, liberal, and pro-western sectors, the second Chechen war offered a chance to show that we have not lost everything.
Almost all Russians now believe that we must defend our interests.
This is the psychological basis of Putin's popularity.
That Russia's genuine national interest – not imperial ambitions – are at the root of the second war in Chechnya is not sufficiently recognized.
Indeed, at the beginning I was myself a strong supporter of Putin, especially when the campaign was directed at terrorists.
Chechnya was a hotbed of anarchy and terrorism, with various clans brutally competing with each other and, in the process, threatening the region's stability.
Conflict was already spreading to neighboring Dagestan; lawlessness was a real danger.
The Chechen War was, thus, a war for our Constitution, which differs from, say, the American Constitution only by the depth and length of its tradition.
Imagine if Alabama suddenly overthrew all democratic institutions.
I am sure America would not hesitate to reestablish constitutional government, even if force was required.
So far, the West will not grant Russia the same rights of democratic self-defense.
Because Russian constitutional norms are considered unstable, imposing them by force appears wilful, anti-democratic.
Yet Russia has the same obligations to defend its constitution as any country.
By defending our constitution we defend democracy.
Wars, of course, have a logic that often defeats the positive motives with which they begin.
As the offensive progressed, Chechen bandits largely hid in the mountains, while Russian might was turned on cities where civilians were dying.
I could not support such barbaric bombings.
So, as the war outgrew its anti-terrorist beginnings and the number of refuges reached 200,000, without the government providing a viable program of aid, I began to waiver.
Chechnya also exacted a political price.
Though the war brought Putin popularity, it weakened his position.
Our generals know that Putin's political success depends on Chechnya; they are blackmailing him by asking for a 150% increase in defense spending, military training in schools, and a call up of 20,000 army reservists.
Putin must finish the war soon if he wants to restore his independence.
So far Putin has offered no long-range plan.
I am convinced that the hardest phase of the fighting will end shortly after the elections.
Yet partisan war will burn, like a fire underground.
What will we do then?
Since no viable local partner is in sight, Russia must work alone to reestablish elementary order in Chechnya.
A Governor-General must be appointed, with responsibility for restoring a basis for human life: a chance to start rebuilding the economy, help for whose who cannot work, and reconstruction of shattered infrastructure.
But the people of Chechnya must be brought in as soon as possible to participate in their government: I think some sort of parliamentary system would be the best, so that various clans would have to work with each other to form coalitions, rather than excluding each other, as they did under the presidential regime of the last few years.
But the outcome of the Chechen war that matters most for Russia and the world is the conflict's impact on our democratic evolution.
Here there is room for optimism.
Elections are preserved. So, too, is freedom of speech, freedom of the media, and the multi-party system.
The supposed hand-over of the journalist Babitsky to the Chechen rebels, and the subsequent fears for his life, inspired widespread public revulsion.
This was a positive sign, for it meant that democracy has taken root.
The life of one man mattered, even in the frenzy of war.
If this year's violence in Chechnya had occurred in 1991, there would have been a real threat to our democratic aspirations.
But though ours is a young constitutional tradition, Russians have been breathing democratic air for ten years now.
We don't want to breathe any other.
We don't want to go back under the ice.
The Chechen war was not only about preserving the Russian state, but also about preserving our democratic constitution.
Russians and Chechens paid a heavy price in lives lost.
We must make sure it was not in vain.
There is widespread agreement that the EU would benefit from further centralization of internal security, and of elements of foreign and defense policy.
According to the last Eurobarometer survey of 2001, 73% of EU citizens support a common defense and security policy, and two Europeans out of three believe that the EU should have one common foreign policy.
This high support for centralization of tasks in these areas contrasts with the still lukewarm overall support for the EU as a whole: only 48% support their country's membership in the EU. 
But does the EU possess the necessary institutions to make these further steps in integration possible?
This is one of the most difficult but relevant questions to be addressed by the convention that will debate Europe's constitution beginning this March. 
In other policy areas, European integration has meant much more than just policy coordination.
Transfer of power from EU member states has always been accompanied by institution building, tailoring the institution to the specific policy area over which integration was needed.
A remarkable feature of this process of integration so far is that it has preserved important dimensions of accountability and control. 
But it is important to appreciate the particular way in which accountability for EU decisions has been preserved, and how it differs from political accountability in a representative democracy.
In a representative democracy, elections are the ultimate instrument for holding politicians accountable.
Citizens delegate decisions to representatives (governments, legislators).
If citizens are not satisfied with the decisions they take, that delegation is not renewed: the previous majority loses the election and is replaced by a new government or a new parliamentary majority. 
This mechanism cannot work in the EU, at least not under the current European constitution.
Governments are the key decision makers in the Council.
But they are accountable to citizens at home, in national elections, and they are primarily judged for their domestic performance, not for EU decisions.
Other EU policymaking bodies (the European Central Bank or the Commission) are appointed, not elected. 
Accountability in the EU has, instead, been achieved through methods that are typical of bureaucratic control, not of politics.
Transfer of power to a EU body has generally been accompanied by a clear operational definition of the policy goals. 
EU policymakers (the ECB, the Commission, the majority in the Council) generally have a narrowly defined "mission": price stability, enforcing the single market, holding prices of agricultural commodities stable.
This has two advantages: it limits discretion by the EU policymakers, and hence insures that transfer of power is not abused; it also facilitates post-transfer accountability and control. 
The European Parliament, the media, the Council, can blame or approve of the way in which EU decision-making power has been used.
Since EU policymakers have a narrow mandate and their decisions are often inspired by external technical criteria, they can be held accountable for their behavior despite the absence of elections. 
This method of bureaucratic control has (so far) worked well in the EU.
It can fruitfully be extended to internal security, where it is possible to define a precise mission for EU policymakers, exploiting the Commission and designing appropriate technical guidelines to achieve clearly defined operational goals. 
The method of bureaucratic control cannot, however, work in the new areas where further centralization is urgently needed: foreign policy and defense.
What mandate can be given in the realm of foreign policy?
The only feasible mandate is to pursue the common interest of the EU. 
But what does that mean in practice?
If the mandate is so incomplete that it leaves too much room for discretional judgment, there is only one way to hold policymakers accountable: through democratic elections.
Only citizens can tell whether policy decisions are really in their interest.
Unfortunately, this instrument is unavailable at the EU level, or at least it is seriously deficient. 
Naturally, limited forms of cooperation are still possible, in foreign and defense policy, through intergovernmental coordination.
They should be pursued as far as possible.
But we should be aware that these forms of cooperation will not take us very far. 
One reason is that both defense and foreign policies rely on well-functioning bureaucracies (a diplomatic corps, the military).
How can the Council acquire control over such bureaucracies?
The Commission, not the Council, is traditionally the bureaucratic arm of the EU.
Developing a EU bureaucracy in foreign policy is a first step towards having an effective European foreign policy. 
Here, however, the Commission competes with national bureaucracies.
In the realm of foreign policy, it seems difficult to exploit the traditional vertical links between the Commission and national bureaucracies that instead have worked so well in dealing with national policy issues. 
We are thus left with a fundamental dilemma.
Europe is now in a situation in which big benefits would come from centralizing foreign and defense policies. But in these areas, bureaucratic control cannot work.
To centralize these policies, a drastic redesign of the EU political constitution might be needed. 
Europe would need to have political institutions more typical of a federation than of a confederation of states.
It is no coincidence that historical episodes of unification of countries coincided with situations in which external threats or a common enemy created large benefits from centralizing defense and foreign policy.
But is Europe capable of jumping to much closer forms of political integration at a time when it is trying to enlarge to the East? 
The twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear accident of April 26, 1986 is prompting a new wave of alarmist claims about its impact on human health and the environment.
As has become a ritual on such commemorative occasions, the death toll is tallied in the hundreds of thousands, and fresh reports are made of elevated rates of cancer, birth defects, and overall mortality.
This picture is both badly distorted – and harmful to the victims of the Chernobyl accident.
All reputable scientific studies conducted so far have concluded that the impact of radiation has been less damaging than was feared.
A few dozen emergency workers who battled the fire at the reactor succumbed to acute radiation sickness.
Studies are still under way into elevated rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease among the “liquidators” who worked at the reactor site in the months following the accident.
And some 5,000 cases of thyroid cancer, attributed to radioactive iodine absorbed through consumption of milk in the weeks immediately following the accident, have been detected among those who were children at the time.
There has been real suffering, particularly among the 330,000 people who were relocated after the accident.
About that there is no doubt.
But, for the five million people living in affected regions who are designated as Chernobyl “victims,” radiation has had no discernable impact on physical health.
This is because these people were exposed to low radiation doses that in most cases were comparable to natural background levels.
Two decades of natural decay and remediation measures mean that most territories originally deemed “contaminated” no longer merit that label.
Aside from thyroid cancer, which has been successfully treated in 98.5% of cases, scientists have not been able to document any connection between radiation and any physical condition.
Where a clear impact has been found is mental health.
Fear of radiation, it seems, poses a far more potent health threat than does radiation itself.
Symptoms of stress are rampant, and many residents of affected areas firmly believe themselves to be condemned by radiation to ill health and early death.
In part, this is because the initial Soviet response was secretive: Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader at the time, addressed the issue on television only weeks later, on May 14, 1986.
Myths and misconceptions have taken root, and these have outlasted subsequent efforts to provide reliable information.
Combined with sweeping government benefit policies that classify millions of people living in Chernobyl-affected areas as invalids, such myths encouraged fatalistic and passive behaviors and created a “culture of dependency” among affected communities.
The United Nations Chernobyl Forum, a consortium of eight UN agencies and representatives of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, reinforced these findings.
Chernobyl Forum was created to address the prevailing confusion concerning the impact of the accident, both among the public and government officials, by declaring a clear verdict on issues where a scientific consensus could be found.
The Forum succeeded in this effort, and a fresh and reassuring message on the impact of radiation was made public in September.
[An easily digestible summary is available at http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernobyl/chernobyl.pdf.]
The Chernobyl Forum findings should have brought relief, for they show that the specter haunting the region is not invincible radiation, but conquerable poverty.
What the region needs are policies aimed at generating new livelihoods rather than reinforcing dependency; public-health campaigns that address the lifestyle issues (smoking and drinking) that undermine health across the former Soviet Union; and community development initiatives that promote self-reliance and a return to normalcy.
But the reception given to the Chernobyl Forum’s message has been surprisingly mixed.
Some officials have reverted to alarmist language on the number of fatalities attributed to Chernobyl.
Some NGO’s and Chernobyl charities have responded with disbelief, citing as evidence the general population’s admittedly poor health.
Opponents of nuclear power have suggested that self-interest has compromised the Chernobyl Forum’s integrity.
Set against the impressive body of science underpinning the Chernobyl Forum, such responses reflect the tenacity not only of myths and misconceptions, but also of vested interests.
The new view on Chernobyl threatens the existence of charities – such as those offering health “respites” abroad for children – that depend for their fund-raising on graphic footage of deformed babies.
The new understanding also deprives the region’s officials of a routine way to seek international sympathy, even if the repetition of such appeals after two decades yields little financial aid.
By misstating the problems, these approaches threaten to divert scarce resources into the wrong remedies.
The twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl accident is an ideal occasion for all actors to do some honest soul-searching.
Governments are right to worry about the fate of Chernobyl-affected territories, but the way forward will require fresh thinking and bold decisions, particularly a shift in priorities from paying paltry benefits to millions to targeted spending that helps to promote jobs and economic growth.
Similarly, charities are right to worry about the population’s health, but they should focus on promoting healthy lifestyles in affected communities rather than whisking children abroad as if their homes were poisonous.
All parties are right to worry about the affected populations, but, more than any sophisticated diagnostic equipment, what is needed is credible information, presented in a digestible format, to counter Chernobyl’s destructive legacy of fear.
The children of Chernobyl are all grown up; their interests, and those of their own children, are best served not by continually evoking the nightmare of radiation, but by giving them the tools and authority they need to rebuild their own communities.
The cries of working children can be heard the world over.
The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that 90 million children between eight and fifteen years old work in the labor forces of developing countries; worldwide the figure is higher.
They often labor under hazardous conditions, handling poisonous chemicals, inhaling noxious fumes, and hauling excessive weights.
They are usually overworked, underfed, and underpaid--if they are paid at all.
Though many countries have enacted laws forbidding the use--and abuse--of children in the work force, optimism about the conditions faced by working children is unwarranted.
That conclusion stems from an inescapable fact: the families of most working children depend on their labors to survive.
Because child labor means cheap labor, the young are often the most employable in developing and recession-plagued economies.
The director of a medium-size textile enterprise in Bangladesh admits without hesitation that 70% of his employees are between the ages of 13 and 17. "They provide the same productivity as adults," he says, "but for a fraction of the cost."
Children, of course, are unlikely to organize or complain to authorities when they are overworked and underpaid.
They are not aware of their legal rights.
It verges on slavery when children are locked up without proper lighting, food, and healthcare.
But they don't question long hours and dire working conditions.
Instead, most are grateful to be working at all.
In Asia and the Pacific, children routinely work endless hours, sleep on factory floors and subsist on scanty rations.
Young Indian factory workers who fail to follow instructions are sometimes regret branded with red-hot iron rods, and some teenage Thai prostitutes are disciplined by having acid thrown in their faces.
For thousands of South American, Caribbean, and African children rented out as maids and houseboys, there is no recourse when they are overworked, beaten, and raped.
As an official of Kenya's Child Welfare Society concedes, "There is little we can do to help when a child is ill-treated unless the case becomes known to us or to the police."
Even when an employer is reasonable, working conditions may still prove dangerous.
Children in Central America harvest crops sprayed with pesticides.
Colombian children squeeze through the narrowest shafts of coalmines.
Thai children toil in unventilated factories, working with glass heated to 1,500 degrees Celsius.
Indian children inhale large doses of sulphur and potassium chlorate to fashion flammable powder into matches.
Youthful glassmakers in Brazil breathe toxic silicone and arsenic fumes.
Sometimes the physical damage from such labors is permanent.
Brazilian, Colombian, and Egyptian youngsters who work in brickyards often suffer irreparable spinal damage from carrying heavy loads.
More generally, children who spend long hours in factories all over the world often enter their teens with permanently deformed limbs.
If they live that long.
Thousands of children don't.
In India safety conditions are so neglected in many factories that numerous children have died in electrical fires and chemical explosions.
Laws exist to protect children from hazardous conditions in many occupations, but they are seldom enforced.
The agricultural sector--the largest employer of children in both developing and industrialized countries--is particularly difficult to oversee.
There is little that officials can do to monitor or modify the children's workloads on large farms or small family enterprises.
In fact, parents often appear to be the harshest taskmasters.
Indian fathers still sometimes repay debts by committing their children to bonded labor.
Pakistani parents occasionally maim their children to make them beguiling beggars.
Sadly, families are often the last to protest exploitation of their children.
The ILO contends that children suffer greatly when they are forced to perform as "small adults." "The child's creativeness and ability to transcend reality are blunted," states one ILO report, "and his whole mental world is impoverished."
The young worker does not learn how to play, or how to read and write; worse, he smokes and, in the Caribbean, he drinks cane rum to keep going, as he doesn't have enough to eat.
In 1973, an ILO convention called for a worldwide minimum working age of 15.
In ten years, only 27 of the ILO's 150 member nations ratified that convention.
Several more countries have laws that set the minimum work age between 12 and 16, but the ILO cautions that few countries "have what could be considered a comprehensive prohibition of dangerous work for young children," and that even fewer have "measures to protect young persons from moral degradation."
Since laws are not the answer to child labor, many experts propose compulsory education as a means to curb it.
But education laws have proved elusive too.
In practically all impoverished societies, parents place wages above education.
As a result, the percentage of dropouts is rising at an alarming rate.
A recent study by UNESCO shows that in developing countries up to 60% of children do not complete primary school.
Relief agencies agree that the total abolition of child labor is an unrealistic goal.
So, for millions of such children, the future holds little promise or hope.
Working children are entitled to something better, regardless of whether they know it.
One puzzling and often overlooked feature of the France that elected Nicolas Sarkozy as its new president, and that is now poised to give his political allies a powerful parliamentary mandate, is its mix of private optimism and public pessimism.
Consider this: France has the highest fertility rate in the European Union (just under two children per woman), even ahead of booming Ireland.
Of course, that rate alone is not enough to sustain France’s current population, but it’s far stronger than its European neighbors and almost equal to that of the US.
Yet, despite this, Eurobarometer polls repeatedly show that the French are the most pessimistic of all Europeans when it comes to their country’s future.
How can it be that people who are so negative about their common future as a nation go about confidently building their private futures within their families?
Indeed, strained by decades of governmental failure to curb massive unemployment, the French are nowadays often perceived as having retired from the political sphere to concentrate on their lives and leisure. Museums, gardening, clubs of all sorts are blossoming in today’s France.
Private associations, it seems, have picked up where political parties and trade unions have left off.
But if the French have turned their backs on the public sphere, how are we to make sense of the record-high participation in the recent presidential election, when more than 85% of turned out to vote in both rounds?
How do we explain the passion aroused by the campaign and by Sarkozy himself including the massive affirmation he received in the parliamentary election?
Political fervor, it seems, has not vanished in the land of Rousseau and Danton.
So the truth must lie elsewhere: the French are not hopeless about politics; they are simply waiting for a genuine leader.
As a matter of fact, a case can be made that the French will never come to believe that the state lacks power, globalization or no globalization.
The French still expect greater things from their government than from an integrated Europe or the boundless world.
Yes, the French are incorrigible lovers of the welfare state (they are not the only ones).
And Sarkozy seems to understand this instinctively.
His agenda appears to aim at domestic liberalization – moving beyond the 35-hour week, ending the special pension regimes accorded to particular professions, increasing incentives to work and gain wealth.
But it also seeks protection from the dizzying effects of globalization, which probably will mean strong support for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, skepticism toward further trade liberalization and the will to improve European Union’s economic government.
Nevertheless, precisely because they care about the future of their numerous children, the French are much more amenable to some wise reforms than most commentators (and politicians) generally assume.
Secondary and higher education are rightly near the top of the agenda list of the new government.
But so are measures aimed at harnessing the state to efforts to encourage entrepreneurship and boost economic dynamism such as public guaranties for housing and start-ups, and fiscal rebate for investment in small enterprises.
France is also in desperate need of a reality check on the nature of its current cultural diversity.
And no one should forget that, despite his campaign rhetoric and his apparent unpopularity with many immigrants, Sarkozy himself is an immigrant’s son who favors bold affirmative action policies.
Besides, the nomination of a woman with a North-African ascent as minister of Justice made that clear from the start.
Most French understand that their public spaces – the labor market, the workplace, housing, and educational institutions – are corroded by discrimination.
France’s impoverished suburbs, the notorious banlieues , make the ideal of “fraternité” sound like an insult on top of an injury.
There is no greater task for Sarkozy than to open, from the inside, all doors to the offspring of others who, like his father, immigrated to France.
So make no mistake about it.
Nicolas Sarkozy has not been elected to adapt France to an elusive globalization.
His mandate is much more demanding: he must reconcile France’s public interests with its private passions.
Can Kosovo achieve independence without the tacit consent of Russia, and can there be a humanitarian and political solution to the tragedy in Darfur without the active goodwill of China?
The two crises have nothing in common, but their resolution will depend in large part on whether these two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council use their veto power.
Comparing the respective abilities of Russia and China to block key international initiatives makes no sense in itself, but it does constitute a useful tool for understanding the transformation of the international system that is now taking place as a direct consequence of the relative decline of America’s global power.
From that standpoint, the deepening of chaos in the Middle East poses both opportunities and risks for Russia and China, which may force them to define the roles they want to play and the images they want to project in the world.
The key question is this: Is Russia taking giant steps in the “wrong direction” while China is taking “minuscule” steps in the “right direction”?
Superficially, Russia and China may give the impression that they are pursuing the same path when they both proclaim with pride that they are “back” on the world stage.
But this boast means different things for each country.
For China, a deeply self-confident country, to be “back” simply means regaining the country’s historical centrality in the world after an absence of more than two centuries.
After all, at the end of the eighteenth century, China became the world’s first producer of manufactured goods, and it perceives itself as a center of civilization unequalled by any other in Asia, if not the world.
China’s renewed self-confidence is based on its remarkable economic prowess, which is derived not from natural resources, but from productivity and creativity.
Whatever the huge political, social, and economic tensions may exist, there is a “feel good” factor in China, a sense of progress, with the 2008 Olympics in Beijing figuring as the symbolic moment that will proclaim to the world the scale of the country’s achievements.
Above all, with the exception of the Taiwan issue, China is a satisfied status quo power when it comes to the evolution of the international system – a patient actor that finds it perfectly legitimate to behave and to be seen as the world’s number two power.
By contrast, the Russians remain insecure about their status in the world.
Russia’s explosive “revisionist” behavior on the eve of the recent G8 summit is an indication of the Kremlin’s “unsatisfied” nature.
Because they know they are less potent, particularly in demographic and economic terms, Russians feel they have to do “more.”
For them, to say “Russia is back” means that the humiliating Yeltsin years are over, and that they now must be treated as equals, particularly by the United States.
Russians are nostalgic not for the Cold War as such, but for the international status they lost when it ended.
Now that America is no longer a “hyperpower” with no strategic challengers, Russia has reasserted its status as a “superpower,” a claim that is not necessarily supported by reality.
Unlike the Chinese, the Russians do not create economic wealth, but merely exploit their energy and mineral resources.
Moreover, unlike the Chinese, they have not always been confident of their position in the world.
Torn between Europe and Asia in cultural and political terms, victimized by a dark, narcissistic instinct that pervades their reading of their past and their visions of the future, it should surprise no one that Russia is now behaving like a “revisionist” power.
Unsatisfied with their inner identity, it is only natural that Russians should demand changes that make them feel more secure and proud.
Less than 20 years ago, the Czech Republic and Poland were part of their sphere of influence, so Russians understandably cannot accept the US unilaterally implanting its security system there.
Of course, in their respective judgments on Russia and China, the West – and Europeans in particular – may be demonstrating selective emotions. “We” tend to be less demanding of China than of Russia, because we tend to see Russia as “European” (at least culturally).
As a result, the culture of physical violence and verbal provocation that is gaining ground in Putin’s Russia is deeply disturbing, whereas we tend to judge Chinese misdeeds with a greater sense of distance, if not indifference.
But the differences between Russia and China today may prove to be less significant tomorrow if the deterioration in the Middle East imposes a sense of collective responsibility on all five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
It is one thing for Russia and China to exploit America’s growing difficulties from Gaza to Kabul; but it is quite another if the situation deteriorates to the point of general destabilization in the region.
Indeed, the Middle East’s deepening problems may impose a sense of restraint in Russia and China by forcing them to calculate not in terms of their global “nuisance value” vis-à-vis the West, but in terms of their ability to make a positive and stabilizing contribution to the world order.
BEIJING – For three decades, China has been growing at an average annual rate of 9.8%.
For most of this time, world markets were favorable, with no major global economic or financial crisis or slowdown.
Yes, there were regional crises such as Southeast Asia’s financial turmoil of 1997-1998 or the collapse of Japan’s housing bubble in 1990 and America’s high-tech bubble in 2000.
But none of these proved a serious obstacle to China’s long boom.
The past three months, however, have seen a significant slowdown in China’s exports, domestic investment, industrial output, and tax revenues.
A major slowdown seems to be looming.
Will China’s rapid growth persist?
I believe it will.
Within China, the current slowdown is mostly homemade.
Since 2004, China’s government has sought to cool an overheating economy by bringing the growth rate down from 12% to a more sustainable 8-9%.
It even began to tax exports in order to reduce the trade surplus.
Of course, if Chinese policymakers could have predicted what has now happened in the world economy, they might have been less stringent in trying to rein in growth.
But one reason that China has been able to maintain growth over the past 30 years is that it started counter-cycle macroeconomic intervention during the boom times, rather than waiting for a collapse.
China’s government never believed that it should leave what happens in the economy solely to the market.
When there is no big bubble, there is no need to worry about a big crisis.
Another reason that China’s strong growth is likely to continue is that its economic fundamentals are sound.
All the factors that encourage high growth remain in place: low labor costs, education, high savings, improving infrastructure, and rapid urbanization.
Moreover, China’s fiscal position is one of the best in the world.
Government deficits rarely exceeded 3% of GDP in past decades, and there were surpluses in recent years.
Indeed, the government debt-to-GDP ratio is about 20%, compared with more than 80% in the United States, 160% in Japan, and 60-90% in Europe.
Monetary policy has been prudent, and the threat of inflation has now been lessened by the decline in commodity and oil prices.
The international balance of payments remains in surplus, and there is still a net capital inflow despite the global credit crunch.
Official foreign exchange reserves will soon reach US$ 2 trillion.
Thus, policymakers have ample room to maneuver if anything should go wrong.
The recent $568 billion fiscal stimulus package, which will be spent on railway expansion, subway construction, low-budget housing programs for the poor, irrigation systems, rural social security, and health care, will add a few percentage points to growth over the next couple years.
With monetary policy and some of the administrative controls on investment and local spending being relaxed, the slowdown should be brief.
But it is not all good news in China’s economy, because low consumption remains a big weakness.
Household consumption only accounted for 34% of GDP and total consumption is less than 50% of GDP in 2007. That weakness, however, is institutional and cannot be easily corrected in the short run.
So, with its domestic economy basically secure, is there anything China can do to help the world economy?
If China can manage to maintain real growth at 8% per annum over the next two years, emerging markets may be able to grow at 4%.
That may prevent the world economy from falling into recession.
Indeed, China now looks like it can play the role of “growth anchor.”
But China should not be expected to do too much more.
World financial stabilization, for example, is not something China can do much to help directly.
China played little part in the global derivatives markets, and does not have much toxic securities to clean up or banks to save in order to unfreeze credit flows.
Perhaps China should use its $1.9 trillion official reserves to buy more foreign debt, but this huge asset pool is already heavily loaded with foreign sovereign bonds, so any increase can only be incremental.
China is also probably unsuited at the moment to play a central role in reforming the global financial and monetary system in 2009 because it has not yet fully liberalized its capital accounts and financial system.
So Chinese negotiators would rather play a supporting role and let others, both developed and developing countries, take the lead in most issues concerning risk control and regulations.
But China is likely to increase its voice on one issue – the US dollar’s status as global reserve currency.
China has been criticized in the past for allegedly manipulating its exchange rate, because it did not revalue its currency as much as the US demanded.
So China might like to see, for example, amendments to the IMF mandate or the addition of a “chapter” to the IMF’s working agenda that discipline America’s money supply and debt accumulation.
In China’s view, it is not enough merely to require others to accommodate themselves to dollar devaluation.
As a developing country with US$ 2,500 per capita income and 35% of its labor force still in agriculture, where workers earn only about $600 per year, China’s domestic problems remain enormous.
Thus, development will continue to be the top priority, including the development of China’s own financial market.
The good news is that China recognizes how much it has benefited from the marketization and openness of the past 30 years.
There is no turning back on its path toward full involvement in the global market, despite the current crisis.
Indeed, the real challenge for China in the year ahead will be to find ways to deal with growing global protectionism as the financial crisis and economic recession bite ever deeper in its main foreign markets.
Beijing – Climate change is a serious challenge to humanity and sustainable development, which requires both proactive responses and concerted effort by the international community.
China attaches great importance to tackling climate change.
In 2007, it established the National Leading Group on Climate Change (NLGCC), headed by Premier Wen Jiabao.
That same year, China issued its National Climate Change Program , the first ever by a developing country.
In its National Climate Change Program , China set an objective to lower its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20% or so of 2005 level by 2010 and in its Mid- and Long-Term Plan for the Development of Renewable Energy , China also sets an objective of increasing the proportion of renewable energy in the primary energy mix to 10% by 2010, and to 15% by 2020.
To achieve such objectives, China has adopted a series of effective policies and measures, achieving remarkable progress.
Firstly, China succeeded in lowering its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 1.79%, 4.04% and 4.59% respectively for 2006, 2007, and 2008, which strongly suggests the prospect of meeting the 20% objective by 2010.
Secondly, between 2006 and 2008, China shut down small thermal power-generation units with a total installed capacity of 34.21 GW, phased out 60.59 million tons of backward steel-making capacity, 43.47 million tons of iron-smelting capacity and 140 million tons of cement-production capacity.
All of these steps reduced pollution markedly.
Thirdly, between 2000 and 2008, China increased its wind power generating capacity from 340 MW to 10 GW, hydropower from 79.35 GW to 163 GW, and nuclear power from 2.1 GW to 9.1 GW.
It has also made great efforts to reduce agricultural and rural greenhouse gas emissions.
Indeed, by the end of 2007, more than 26.5 million rural households were using household biogas digesters, thereby avoiding CO2 emissions by 44 million tons.
Fourthly, China has increased its carbon sinks by promoting reforestation.
China’s forest coverage rate increased from 12% in the early 1980’s to 18.21% today.
For this year, China will complete formulating provincial climate change programs throughout the country, promoting effective implementation of the National Climate Change Program .
Furthermore, in China’s economy stimulus package, 210 billion yuan is allocated for energy conservation, pollutants reduction, and ecosystem protection projects, 370 billion yuan for economic structural adjustment and technology renovation, and 400 billion yuan for new energy-efficient housing that will use environmentally friendly materials.
Besides, 370 billion yuan will be used to improve rural living standards in an environmentally sound manner and sustainable way.
China is making huge efforts to combat climate change despite the fact that it remains a low-income developing country with a per-capita GDP of just about $3,000.
Indeed, by United Nations standards, China still has 150 million people living in poverty.
China has no other choice but to pursue sustainable development in order to meet the basic needs of its people and to eradicate poverty.
In this process, the world is assured that China will make every effort to address climate change.
The international community has great expectations for reaching a positive outcome in Copenhagen.
In China’s view, the key to the success in Copenhagen lies in the realization of the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol (KP).
Developed country Parties to the KP, collectively, must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25-40% below their 1990 level by 2020.
For Non-KP developed countries, they should undertake comparable commitments with quantified emission reduction targets.
Developed countries should also fulfill their obligations under the Convention to provide financial support and technology transfer to enable developing countries to effectively tackle climate change.
In addition, appropriate mechanisms and institutional arrangements should be established for adaptation, financial support and technology transfer.
Developing countries will, in the context of sustainable development and with measurable, reportable, and verifiable support in terms of financing, technology, and capacity-building, take nationally appropriate mitigation actions.  
The global financial crisis has undoubtedly exacerbated the challenge of climate change.
But since climate change is a more far-reaching and serious challenge, the world must not waver in its determination and commitment to addressing it.
Indeed, the international financial crisis, if handled properly, may also be turned into an opportunity to reach a win-win solution for both climate protection and economic development.
With a deep sense of responsibility for its own people and the entire human race, China will continue to implement proactive policies and measures to address climate change and make unremitting efforts to the protection of earth system.
BOSTON – The anti-Japan protests that continue to roil China are just another indication of the rise of a potent Chinese nationalism.
After a century slowly fomenting among Chinese intellectuals, national sentiment has captured and redefined the consciousness of the Chinese people during the last two decades of China’s economic boom.
This mass national consciousness launched the Chinese colossus into global competition to achieve an international status commensurate with the country’s vast capacities and the Chinese people’s conception of their country’s rightful place in the world.
Rapidly, visibly, and inevitably, China has risen.
Indeed, our era will likely be remembered as the time when a new global order, with China at the helm, was born.
Competitive national consciousness – the consciousness that one’s individual dignity is inseparably tied to the prestige of one’s “people” – worked its way into the minds of China’s best and brightest between 1895 and 1905.
In 1895, China was defeated by Japan, a tiny aggressor whom the Chinese dismissively called wa (the dwarf).
China was already accustomed to rapacious Western powers squabbling over its riches, but had remained self-confident in the knowledge of these powers’ irrelevance.
However, the assault from Japan, a speck of dust in its own backyard, shattered this self-assurance and was experienced as a shocking and intolerable humiliation.
Japan’s triumph in 1905 over “the Great White Power,” Russia, repaired the damage to China’s sense of dignity.
From the Chinese point of view, Russia was a formidable European power, one feared by other Western powers.
Its defeat, therefore, was seen as a successful Asian challenge to the West, in which China, its intellectuals felt, was represented by Japan.
Japan thus became the focus of Chinese attention.
Gentlemen-scholars, who would reform and staff the Chinese army and civil service in the early decades of the twentieth century, went to study in Japan.
The Revolution of 1911 was inspired by the example of Japan’s Meiji Restoration; and, because early-twentieth-century Japan was stridently nationalistic, the new China that emerged from its image was constructed on nationalist principles as well.
Thus Japan became the significant “other” for China, the model that was imitated and the anti-model that was resented.
Chinese nationalism borrowed from Japan its concept of the nation, including the very word by which it was expressed (kuoming, from the Japanese kokumin).
The


Kuomintang (the Chinese Nationalist Movement) was explicitly inspired by Japan and fueled by repeated Japanese aggression.

Paradoxically, but not unexpectedly, Mao Zedong’s struggle against the Kuomintang was inspired by anti-Japanese nationalism as well. As was the case virtually everywhere else, communism in China was nationalism incarnate.
Mao’s speech on the establishment of the People’s Republic plainly expressed the nationalist agenda behind it.
Calling the nation “communist” assured the new People’s Republic of China of the Soviet Union’s support, which was viewed by Mao as more reliable than that of the United States. But neither the Russian nor the Chinese Communists were ever unclear about the nationalist nature of their respective projects.
The upper echelons of the bureaucracy and intelligentsia in Russia and China were self-consciously nationalist and, throughout Communist rule, shrewdly pursued the supreme nationalist goal: prestige – the power, naked and otherwise, to impose the nation’s will on others.
But national consciousness, particularly in China, was limited to a narrow elite, leaving the masses almost untouched.
This changed dramatically with the Chinese government’s restoration of a capitalist economy.
Much like in Germany in the 1840’s, when the appeal to private enterprise converted the entire middle class to nationalism, the explicit definition of economic power as the central pillar of China’s greatness awakened ordinary Chinese to nationalism’s appeal.
Hundreds of millions now see themselves as sharing in the nation’s dignity, and are eager to contribute to it, as well as to defend it from insult.
Competition for prestige, even when the contest is economic, is not a purely rational undertaking.
So it should be no surprise that old injuries are likely to resurface. Some Chinese, especially those who are not economically successful, harp bitterly on Japan’s past depredations.
Despite China’s embrace of capitalism and Japanese investment, Japan remains China’s reviled other. Indeed, a professor in Beijing told me not long ago, “Two in every ten Chinese dislike the US, but nine in every ten hate Japan.”
For the West, there is a silver lining in this nationalist rivalry: neither China nor Japan is a rogue state, and, so long as their quarrels do not lead to the use of unconventional weapons, we may treat the friction between them as an internal Asian quarrel.
Japan, moreover, is likely to let today’s passions over disputed islands in the East China Sea cool down, despite the anti-Japanese outbursts in Chinese cities.
But the West – and the US in particular – is new to dignity games à la Chinois. If it gets carried away and presumes to talk down to the 5,000-year-old culture of the Sages, the West could become the next object of China’s nationalist resentment.
Despair is dangerous in diplomacy.
But North Korea's latest actions are making much of Asia hopeless.
Only China, long reluctant to flex its diplomatic muscles, now has the power to find a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear problem.
But the question everyone from Tokyo to Seoul and from Washington to Moscow is asking is this: will China act in time?
China's influence on North Korea is uniquely powerful.
China is keeping its increasingly desperate neighbor on life support by providing most of the non-food aid and energy that North Korea receives from abroad.
But to prevent North Korea from realizing a fait accompli in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, China must do more than mediate between North Korea and the US, the role it has so far played.
Instead, it must now prompt North Korea to halt its nuclear development activities and return to the six-party talks with America, Japan, China, Russia, and South Korea that broke up weeks ago.
Recent developments indicate that North Korea's nuclear threat is becoming more serious by the day.
Two weeks ago, North Korea declared that in June it successfully reprocessed some 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods and now possesses "nuclear deterrence," suggesting that Kim Jong Il's regime may actually be making atomic bombs.
Not only does North Korea show little interest in holding another session of the six-party talks that the Bush administration and the other participants are calling for; it now wants to ban the Japanese from participating.
Kim accuses Japan of introducing unnecessary obstacles and complications into resolution of the nuclear question by raising the sensitive issue of North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens.
But this is nothing more than a political diversion.
It is inconceivable that multilateral negotiations could result in a breakthrough toward a diplomatic solution while North Korea is actively engaged in pursuing its nuclear weapons program.
It must be clear by now that Pyongyang is determined to keep its nuclear weapons program in order to obtain a credible assurance from the US that its bizarre and repressive regime will be allowed to survive.
Unless America accommodates North Korea's demands for concluding a nonaggression treaty and ending "hostile" policies, Kim's regime is likely to keep its nuclear weapons program as its most effective deterrent against any preemptive US attack--something that the Bush administration, indeed, refuses to rule out.
America's military victory in the war in Iraq probably hardened North Korea's resolve to rely on the nuclear option as its primary means of ensuring regime survival.
But that should not surprise anyone: the North Korean regime has always been committed to making military power the "first priority" in the state budget.
This contrasts sharply with policies pursued by China and Vietnam, Asia's two other communist powers.
In both countries, the leadership places military power last in their national development strategies.
It would be difficult for the US to change the highest priority of its own national security strategy--preempting terrorism and fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction--especially with another nuclear threat looming in Iran.
Insofar as the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula is concerned, the US has thus succeeded by sustaining an ad hoc concert of powers thus far with China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea.
Indeed, in their first-ever joint declaration, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, and South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun issued a plea on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit held in Bali on October 8 for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
All sides realize that failure to achieve this would most likely result in a nuclear chain reaction with Japan, South Korea, and perhaps even Taiwan embarking on their own nuclear weapons development programs.
That scenario is China's worst nightmare.
So the question now is what can China do to freeze--and, if possible, to reverse--North Korea's nuclear program.
China finds itself in a delicate position, pulled in one direction by its desire to avoid a precipitous North Korean collapse, and in the opposite direction by its overriding need to deepen economic relations with the US, Japan, and South Korea.
This is why at the UN Security Council China opposed any military action or sanctions against North Korea, a country for which it sacrificed almost one million troops during the Korean War in 1950-53.
It is in China's vital national interest to halt North Korea's quest to become another declared nuclear power.
China's success here would not only enhance its own international prestige, but would also contribute immensely to promoting regional stability and prosperity throughout East Asia.
In recent weeks, China announced a 12.6% increase in its defense spending; America’s CIA director, Porter Goss, testified about a worsening military balance in the Taiwan Strait; and President George W. Bush pleaded with Europeans not to lift their embargo on arms sales to China.
Yet Chinese leaders have spoken of China’s “peaceful rise” or, more recently, its “peaceful development.”
Analysts such as John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago have flatly proclaimed that China cannot rise peacefully, and predict that “the United States and China are likely to engage in an intense security competition with considerable potential for war.”
Optimists point out that China has engaged in good neighbor policies since the 1990’s, settled border disputes, played a greater role in international institutions, and recognized the benefits of using soft power.
But skeptics reply that China is merely waiting for its economy to lay the basis for future hegemony.
Who is right?
We will not know for some time, but the debaters should recall Thucydides’ warning more than two millennia ago that belief in the inevitability of conflict can become one of its main causes.
Each side, believing it will end up at war with the other, makes reasonable military preparations that are read by the other side as confirmation of its worst fears.
In fact, the “rise of China” is a misnomer. “Re-emergence” would be more accurate, since by size and history the Middle Kingdom has long been a major power in East Asia.
Technically and economically, China was the world’s leader (though without global reach) from 500 to 1500.
Only in the last half-millennium was it overtaken by Europe and America.
The Asian Development Bank has estimated that in 1820, at the beginning of the industrial age, Asia accounted for three-fifths of world output.
By 1940, this fell to one-fifth, even though Asia was home to three-fifths of the world’s population.
Rapid economic growth has brought output back to two-fifths of the world total today, and the Bank speculates that Asia could return to its historical levels by 2025.
Asia, of course, includes Japan, India, Korea, and others, but China will eventually play the largest role.
Its high annual growth rates of 8-9% led to a tripling of its GNP in the last two decades of the twentieth century.
Nonetheless, China still has a long way to go and faces many obstacles.
The US economy is about twice the size of China’s; if it grows by only 2% annually, and China’s economy grows by 6%, they could reach parity sometime after 2025.
Even so, they would not be equal in composition or sophistication.
China would still have a vast, underdeveloped countryside, and would not equal the US in per capita income until sometime after 2075 (depending on the measures of comparison.)
China is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to American preponderance that the Kaiser’s Germany posed when it surpassed Britain in the years leading up to World War I.
Moreover, simple projections of economic growth trends can mislead.
Countries tend to pick the low-hanging fruit as they benefit from imported technologies in the early stages of economic take-off, and growth rates generally slow as economies reach higher levels of development.
In addition, China’s economy suffers from inefficient state-owned enterprises, a shaky financial system, and inadequate infrastructure.
At the same time, politics has a way of confounding economic projections.
Creating a rule of law and institutions for political participation has lagged behind economic growth, and growing inequality, massive internal migration, an inadequate social safety net, and corruption could foster political instability.
Indeed, some observers fear instability caused by a weak , rather than a rising, China.
As long as China’s economy does grow, its military power will likely increase, thus making China appear more dangerous to its neighbors and complicating America’s commitments in Asia.
A RAND study projects that by 2015, China’s military expenditure will be more than six times higher than Japan’s, and its accumulated military capital stock will be roughly five times higher (measured at purchasing power parity).
Whatever the accuracy of such assessments of China’s military growth, the outcome will also depend on what the US and other countries do.
The key to military power in the information age depends on the ability to collect, process, disseminate, and integrate complex systems of space-based surveillance, high speed computers, and “smart” weapons.
China and others will develop some of these capabilities, but, according to many military analysts, China is not likely to close the gap with the US soon.
China’s inability to compete with the US on a global basis does not mean that it could not challenge the US in East Asia, or that war over Taiwan is impossible.
Weaker countries sometimes attack when they feel backed into a corner, such as Japan did at Pearl Harbor or China did when it entered the Korean War in 1950.
If, for example, Taiwan were to declare independence, China would likely intervene with armed force, regardless of the perceived economic or military costs.
But it would be unlikely to win such a war, and prudent policy on both sides can make such a war unlikely.
There is no need for the US and China to go to war.
Not every rising power leads to war – witness America’s overtaking of Britain at the end of the nineteenth century.
If China’s rise remains peaceful, it promises great benefits to its own people and to its neighbors – and to Americans.
But, remembering Thucydides’ advice, it will be important not to mistake analysts’ theories for reality, and to continue pointing this out to political leaders and publics.
It is rare for a foreign doctor to get to China’s rural areas, where its AIDS epidemic was born and takes a horrible toll.
But recently, two nurses and I ventured into a poor farming area, Nizui in Hubei Province, as part of a Medecins Sans Frontières(MSF) team to visit the Liu family and evaluate their 7-month-old baby.
The child was the size of a two month old, but his eyes held the gaze of an 80-year-old man long acquainted with extreme suffering.
The baby was dying of AIDS.
His parents, aunts, and uncles were also HIV-positive.
The Liu family is one of thousands of poor farming families in China’s interior who contracted HIV through contaminated blood donations during the 1990’s, when under-regulated for-profit blood banking companies reused needles and transferred blood from infected donors to clean donors after extracting the plasma.
The Chinese Health Ministry recently put the total number of HIV/AIDS cases at 840,000, although most experts believe that the true number is much higher.
Some believe that by 2010, the number of infected Chinese may reach 10 million.
After years of taking a passive, low-profile approach to the epidemic, health officials have stepped up their anti-HIV campaign.
Since 80% of HIV/AIDS patients reside in the countryside, greater access to health care in these areas has become a priority.
This past July, during the highly publicized 15th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Premier Wen Jiabao declared all-out war against the burgeoning epidemic.
Earlier this year, the government promised blood-products screening, free voluntary HIV testing, and free medicine for the poor.
This new anti-HIV/AIDS campaign, which the international community has lauded, is more open and proactive than before.
But it must still operate in the context of a closed society, where government control over the media limits the flow of information necessary to deal with any public health epidemic.
Moreover, it is unclear how care will be delivered to the rural front lines, where the old system of clinics based in Peoples’ Communes collapsed with the de-collectivization of agriculture.
To be effective, clinics in areas where HIV/AIDS is prevalent must provide patients with the same standard of care that is offered for other health conditions.
Unfortunately, the door to such access remains largely closed, partly because China was initially reluctant to allow overseas groups into their hinterlands to assist.
Nonetheless, local and foreign NGO’s are now starting to play a role in filling the gap between government policies and front-line healthcare delivery.
In May 2003, MSF was authorized to set up an HIV/AIDS clinic in Xiangfan, Hubei Province.
On my recent visit, I met Mr. Du, a thin-framed, HIV-positive farmer who lost his wife to AIDS last year and was desperate to prevent his infected 7-year-old son from meeting the same fate.
He had been taking the boy all over China by train, bus, and truck in search of help.
Last month alone, they visited five large cities without success.
The chance that Mr. Du, and those like him, will find help in China is slim; at present, most clinics and hospitals are not adequately prepared to treat HIV-infected patients.
Treatment is extremely limited where it is available.
For example, Xiangfan’s Infectious Diseases Hospital is the prefecture’s only health facility where HIV/AIDS patients can be admitted.
On paper, the hospital appears well staffed and adequately equipped, but on my rounds there, I found the halls and wards deserted and barren.
Few therapeutic and diagnostic options were available.
Even a basic test like a CAT scan would require transport to another regional hospital.
But under-equipped hospitals may not be the greatest obstacle to controlling China's AIDS crisis.
Equally harmful are the government’s sensitivity to its own policy failures and the stigma attached to a disease that is often sexually transmitted.
Indeed, information is so limited and the stigma so strong that ordinary people – and sometimes medical personnel – often ostracize AIDS patients.
Patients who do receive care are often treated with substandard, even harmful, medicine.
According to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, patients in China can have a 40-50% chance of being sold fake over-the-counter remedies and an even higher chance of being sold fake prescription drugs.
Some of these counterfeit products contain toxic ingredients.
Foreign NGOs such as MSF insist on using medications that are up to World Health Organization standards, but the Chinese government insists that such restrictive measures are excessive.
Although MSF uses its own drug supply, Chinese patients still often buy medicine with unknown ingredients and efficacy on the street.
Safety regulations must, at a minimum, be applied to the prescription of the anti-retroviral medications that fight HIV, because such drugs are extremely sensitive to dosage changes and interactions with other medicines.
Improper use of these medicines fosters HIV resistance and provides little therapeutic value for patients.
There is no quick-fix solution to ending China’s AIDS crisis.
Officials there must focus not only on developing a pragmatic, realistic healthcare infrastructure in rural areas, but also on bringing about greater openness in China’s media in order to spread life-saving public information.
Like all epidemics, HIV/AIDS in China is a public health crisis that can only be solved with the mass dissemination of accurate information.
Transforming promises and policies into patient rights, awareness, and effective health care will undoubtedly take time, especially for a country as massive and lacking in transparency as China.
For the hundreds of thousands of HIV sufferers, this is likely to be more time than they have left.
China’s tortuous road toward membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is winding toward its end.
Before China joins, however, the final terms on which it enters the WTO must be negotiated with a group of WTO members acting on behalf of the organization and expressed in a formal agreement, the Protocol of Accession.
Big legal issues that have been put to the side must now be tackled.
When China joins the WTO, it will become committed (like all other members) to policies and practices that have been agreed on by the international community of trading nations and are expressed in the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other multilateral treaties.
China’s lengthy negotiations with the US and the European Union over WTO membership largely focused on vexatious economic issues, such as lowering tariffs, ending quotas on exports to China, opening its market to key imports where access has hitherto been excluded or limited, and permitting foreign investment in industries such as telecommunications.
Those bilateral negotiations will benefit other members of the WTO as well, because membership in the WTO obligates China to treat all other members equally.
Too little attention has been paid, however, to other matters that will also affect all WTO members, namely the measures that China must take to raise its level of legality to meet standards set down in the GATT.
A draft of the Protocol of Accession – under negotiation for years but not yet final – contains provisions that could change Chinese law and accelerate the construction of a legal system, a process that only began twenty years ago when Deng Xiaoping launched China’s economic reforms.
China has already agreed to move toward meeting relevant WTO standards, such as Article X of the GATT, which obligates members to apply trade laws in a “uniform, fair and reasonable manner.”
In China, however, such uniformity is unattainable today because the actions of local governments frequently diverge from central government policy.
China’s courts and the salaries of its judges are funded, not by the Beijing, but by local governments, which makes judges and the courts beholden to them.
Fairness and reasonableness are also distant goals, because there is vast disorder among Chinese law-making institutions, central and local alike.
The draft Protocol contains language in which China agrees to establish independent “tribunals… and procedures for the prompt review of all disputes relating to the implementation of laws, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application.” China cannot meet this standard, either.
Chinese law limits the types of bureaucratic actions that can be challenged by lawsuit, such as abuses of discretion.
Also, Chinese law limits the questioning of administrative rules before they are put into practice.
Although much activity is under way to draft legislation to reform administrative law, these drafts are unlikely to be adopted for years.
These issues are of enormous practical importance for companies doing business with China.
For unless these changes are made, how can businessmen know how to ascertain the lawfulness of the actions of Chinese officials, such as imposing fees or penalties, refusing to award contracts, or imposing conditions on contract approvals?
The draft Protocol does not yet require China to adopt rules to govern administrative procedure or the standards of evidence to be used by administrative agencies.
Nor does it address deficiencies in existing legislation that prevent challenges to the rules on which agencies base their decisions or to the exercise of discretion by bureaucrats.
The Protocol’s current draft, indeed, falls well short of the necessary specificity.
Even if the language of the Protocol is sharpened before China joins the WTO, China’s trading partners should hold realistic expectations about the limited results China can attain even if its reforms are energetic and sincere.
A legal tradition vastly different from the West, and decades of Maoist rule before the Deng era, make rapid change in Chinese legal institutions impossible.
The consequences of this may be severe.
China’s failure to meet GATT standards may catalyze any number of disputes, enough to overload the WTO dispute settlement process, and the processes of obtaining decisions and implementing them could be very time-consuming.
What is to be done?
China’s trading partners and foreign NGO’s can provide needed assistance to China by supporting programs that foster improvements in Chinese legality.
The EU, Canada and the Asian Development Bank are already engaged in such efforts.
Despite past refusal by America’s Congress to fund programs to further the rule of law in China, recent US legislation authorizes modest efforts to provide assistance to increase China’s capacity to meet its obligations as a WTO member.
China’s admission to the WTO will mark another stage of its membership in the international community.
None of this should be greeted with euphoria, for China’s markets will not open magically and China’s governance will not change quickly.
Successful change will require clear expectations and much effort on all sides.
With rare candor, China's government recently released statistics on people arrested and prosecuted for endangering state security, the most serious political offence in the criminal code.
China's top prosecutor, Han Zhubin, revealed that more than 3,400 people were arrested from 1998 to 2002 for such crimes as subversion, incitement to subversion, espionage, and trafficking in state secrets.
Arrests and prosecutions for endangering state security have risen sharply since September 11, 2001.
In the two-year period that ended on December 31, 2002, more than 1,600 people were prosecuted for endangering state security, most after the terror attacks on the US.
Many of those arrested and prosecuted hail from Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the northwest of the country that is home to a large and restive Muslim population.
China's government has used the war on terror to crack down on those seeking greater autonomy, including those who do so by peaceful means.
This includes people like Rebiya Kadeer, a businesswoman imprisoned for sending newspaper articles to her husband in the US, Tohti Tunyaz, a Ph.D. student in Japan accused of publishing "sensitive documents," and Tursunjan Amat, a poet who recited a pro-independence poem at a public gathering in Urumqi.
Large as the number of such arrests and prosecutions is, the true extent of the government's suppression of independent thought and activity is even greater.
Most members of the Falun Gong and other unauthorized religions are arrested and tried for "using an evil cult to sabotage implementation of the law"--a crime categorized as "disturbing the social order."
Thousands of people are imprisoned for such "evil cult" activities.
Labor leaders are often charged with "organizing an illegal procession" or "disturbing the social order."
Dissidents who attempt to fund their activities by conducting private business sometimes find themselves jailed for economic crimes like fraud and illegal publishing.
Fang Jue, a reformer who served a four-year term for economic crimes, and Jiang Surang, an underground Catholic priest sentenced to six years for illegally publishing Bibles, were both punished in this way.
Dissidents picked up by the police but not formally arrested sometimes wind up in re-education camps or in psychiatric hospitals run by the public security bureau.
Those sentenced to two- or three-year terms of "re-education through labor" are not included in the statistics on endangering state security released by Procurator General Han.
The names of only a few of the thousands arrested for political crimes are known.
An exhaustive search of official and unofficial sources turned up fewer that 150 names of individuals arrested for endangering state security in 1998-2002, a "transparency rate" of less than 5%.
Indeed, we know more about the arrests made after the Tiananmen protests of 1989 than about those arrested today.
What we do know about those arrested is as disturbing as the arrests themselves.
For example, about one-quarter are non-Han Chinese, principally Tibetans and Uyghurs.
China is more than 90% Han.
Sentences for non-Han Chinese are typically longer than those imposed on Han Chinese.
Moreover, almost everyone arrested for endangering state security is convicted.
Appeals, when filed, are routinely rejected.
In the one or two cases of acquittal, another charge is filed and a conviction obtained.
That happened to Yue Zhengzhong, who sent an intercepted letter to the US Embassy praising the 1999 bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade.
Prosecuted for inciting subversion, Yue was ultimately convicted of "making a false accusation."
He had written that those killed deserved their fate.
Although some of those convicted of endangering state security are charged with violent crimes--for example, two Tibetans were recent sentenced to death for "inciting separatism" and setting off bombs--the great majority involve non-violent speech and association.
Dozens of leaders of opposition groups--most unknown to the outside world--were imprisoned in recent years.
Li Wenshan and Chen Shiqing, leaders of the Chinese Nation's Democratic Party, which has nearly 1,000 members, are serving long sentences in Gansu Province's Linxia Prison.
"Internet dissidents" make up the fastest-growing group of political prisoners.
Last month, Huang Qi, an Internet entrepreneur arrested for posting articles criticizing the Communist Party, and four young intellectuals who made up the "New Youth Study Group" to hold online discussions about political reform, were sentenced to long prison terms.
Scholars, too, feel the heat.
Xu Zerong, a social scientist trained at Harvard and Oxford, is serving a 13-year sentence in Guangdong Province for photocopying materials on Chinese military tactics during the 1950-53 Korean War.
Many hope that the SARS crisis will encourage China's leaders to become more transparent and accountable.
But the way the authorities are handling the epidemic is having the opposite effect.
Internal travel restrictions are used to keep lawyers from representing dissident clients.
Prisons are closed to outside visitors.
Meetings with foreign governments on human rights--during which information is provided on political cases--have been postponed and visits by monitors, including one from the World Psychiatric Association to investigate charges of psychiatric abuse, are on hold.
No one knows when the long-promised visit by the UN Rapporteur on Torture will take place.
We may get a better picture of China's public health system as a result of the SARS crisis, but when it comes to the country's political health, there is little to suggest that criticism will be tolerated or opposition allowed.
Those who attempt to change the way China is governed will be dealt with harshly, their names and fates remaining anonymous.
For over a decade, American strategic thinking has focused on China's emergence as a great power in East Asia.
Such thinking is passé.
China already is East Asia's great power.
While America has struggled in Iraq this year, China has spent it on a diplomatic goodwill offensive in Asia.
The result?
In October, one day after President George W. Bush was booed in Australia's parliament, Chinese President Hu Jintao received a standing ovation from the same parliamentarians.
China's emergence as Asia's dominant power, and the overall regional balance of power, are now matters that governments across the Pacific must reckon with carefully.
To be sure, the US remains Asia's power broker, as it has been since the end of WWII.
But diplomacy regarding the Korean peninsula, in which all roads lead to Beijing, has opened the door to China as the new "go-to" guy.
Indeed, the six-party meetings in Beijing earlier this year to discuss North Korea's nuclear challenge confirmed China's emerging great power status, which is also reflected in its increasingly active--and effective--Asian diplomacy.
This includes even Japan, China's traditional rival.
This past May, Chinese President Hu Jintao met with Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Hu's move lifted bilateral relations out of the deep freeze, where China's previous leadership had consigned them following Koizumi's repeated visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, where the spirits of Japan's war dead, including Class A war criminals, are enshrined.
Unlike former Chinese president Jiang Zemin, whose history lectures irritated Japan's postwar generations, Hu focused on the future, avoiding the dreaded "Y" word in the meeting with Koizumi.
The Japanese media took note.
In August, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, attended ceremonies in Beijing marking the 25th anniversary of the China-Japan Friendship Treaty.
At the same time, China's Foreign Minister, Li Zhaoxing, traveled to Tokyo.
In September, Japan's Defense Minister visited China, resuming high-level defense contacts.
If all goes well, a Koizumi visit to China may be in the offing.
Koizumi has long sought an official visit, only to be stymied by Chinese opposition to his Yasukuni visits.
His interest is understandable.
Last year, Japan's imports from China surpassed those from the US for the first time, while annual exports to China soared by 39.3%.
Even as the SARS epidemic raged in China, Japanese companies kept their long-term investment bets on the promise of low-cost Chinese labor.
China has been equally active to its south and west.
In June, during the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh, China announced that it will sign the 1976 Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, ASEAN's founding document.
China's accession to ASEAN represents a major confidence-building step toward Southeast Asia.
It follows China's 2001 proposal for a China-ASEAN free trade area and its active financial support for Thailand and Indonesia during the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis.
Talk of a "strategic partnership" is in the air.
Meanwhile in South Asia, after hosting Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee in Beijing, China and India signed a Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation.
India acknowledges in the document that Tibet is part of China and proscribes anti-Chinese activities by Tibetans from Indian soil.
In November, the first ever India-China joint naval exercises were held off the Chinese coast.
If the US is looking to develop a post-Cold War strategic relationship with India to counter Chinese influence in South and Southeast Asia, the recent China-India agreements suggests that an alternative strategic calculus may exist in both China and India.
The US must recognize that, while the countries of the region look to the US to balance--or at least leaven--China's growing influence, they are unlikely to be interested in getting caught up in any containment strategy.
For now, US and Chinese interests coincide on the war on terrorism, on a peaceful resolution of the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, and on stability in East Asia.
Over the long-term, however, accommodation will be difficult on issues like Taiwan, Korean reunification, and the future of the US alliance structure in Asia.
Moreover, on the fundamental issue of freedom--"the non-negotiable demand of human dignity," in the words of the Bush administration's National Security Strategy--American and Chinese visions conflict.
Clearly, the war on terrorism presented China with opportunities to strengthen both its relations with the US and its ties with nations across the Pacific.
The big question is whether today's cooperation between China and the US will prove to be no more than a diversion from Asia's enduring strategic reality--China's emergence as the region's dominant power.
The safest bet is that Asia's realities outlast the war on terrorism, and that after Afghanistan and Iraq, when the US refocuses on Asia, it will find a very different China in a much-changed region.
Whatever the ultimate economic effects of China’s first modest step towards floating its currency, one has to admire its strategic brilliance.
The genius of China’s mini-move (allowing the Yuan to rise 2% against the dollar) is that no one can tell when or what is going to happen next.
Protectionists in the United States and Europe, itching to slap huge punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, have been caught flat-footed.
They want to keep bathing in press coverage, but if they push their China-bashing too far and too fast, the protectionists will be seen as hindering delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations.
But no one knows whether China’s baby step is the start of something much bigger, as China’s authorities hint one day and deny the next.
By relenting just a little to intense global pressure to revalue its exchange rate, the Chinese leadership has masterfully stifled the growing chorus of demands to rein in its growing trade surplus.
The key question, however, remains whether China is defying market forces at its own risk.
On the surface, at least, the mini-revaluation hardly seems to have compromised China’s ability to bend exchange markets to its will.
Foreign experts had warned that a small Yuan appreciation might be worse than none.
While hardly denting global trade imbalances, a small move would bring in a flood of foreign capital, overwhelming China’s currency defenses and leading to chaos.
So far, that has not happened and, China once again seems to have gone its own way and proved the experts wrong.
But hold the applause.
Perhaps the speculative-inflow scenario will play out, but in slow motion.
After all, China is not a country where investors can just take their money in a heartbeat.
It can hold the fort because it maintains one of the world’s strictest regimes of exchange and capital controls.
Unlike many Latin American and former Soviet-bloc countries, where similar controls are honored mainly in the breach, violating capital controls in China is virtually a capital offense.
But, over the past fifty years, when many other countries, including France and Italy, implemented draconian controls, the result was always the same: eventually, the private sector adapted and eroded the controls’ effectiveness.
Whether by misreporting imports and exports or exploiting corrupt government officials (which China has in ample supply), private capital eventually starts finding its way around the controls if the incentives are strong enough.
Thus, even if the Chinese authorities can somehow keep their capital controls from hemorrhaging as the country’s financial system becomes more sophisticated and decentralized, they will not be able to stop the controls from dying a death of a thousand cuts.
After that, China will be able to keep its exchange rate pegged only by slavishly following US interest-rate policy, which makes no sense for such a large and diverse region.
Indeed, over the longer term, the biggest concern for China is that some day money will be trying to get out.
Even China’s vast reserves will not be enough to stave off a painful devaluation.
It is a lot easier to exit from a fixed exchange rate regime when the pressures on the currency are upwards.
While it may seem hard to imagine that the speculative tide might ever turn against China, exchange-rate pressures can turn in an instant.
Today’s darling currency can be tomorrow’s dog.
Considering China’s huge and growing income inequalities, and its massive disguised rural unemployment, it is easy to imagine a period of political instability that sends investors heading for the exits.
Mix in China’s shaky financial system and the prospect of trade sanctions after an altercation over, say, Taiwan, and it is clear that the Yuan might not always be a one-way bet.
Last but not least, the Chinese authorities desperately need to maintain the country’s breakneck economic growth in order to preserve the Communist Party’s legitimacy.
But, as the economy becomes richer and more complex, there will be no escaping the market imperative in internal credit allocation.
Every other emerging market, even in Asia, has eventually had to cross this bridge.
Indeed, the need to pursue financial liberalization to maintain growth is a central reason why middle-income countries are so prone to financial crises.
That’s why Chinese authorities should move to greater flexibility now, and not wait until it is too late.
So should we expect to see much bigger currency moves in China anytime soon?
Should we ever expect to see wild gyrations in China’s exchange rate of the sort one routinely sees in, say, the Australian dollar or the South African rand?
Neither scenario is very likely.
Only fire-breathing free-market advocates, seemingly oblivious to the fact that China’s shaky financial system cannot survive liberalization overnight, are calling for an extreme version of floating.
But there may well be a lot more to come over the next 12-18 months.
The first round of Yuan revaluation won’t be over until the currency is up against the dollar by at least 10%, and probably more.
China’s first currency move was brilliant only if it is not the last.
CAMBRIDGE – Chinese-American relations are, once again, in a downswing.
China objected to President Barack Obama’s receiving the Dalai Lama in the White House, as well as to the administration’s arms sales to Taiwan.
There was ample precedent for both American decisions, but some Chinese leaders expected Obama to be more sensitive to what China sees as its “core interests” in national unity.
Things were not supposed to turn out this way.
A year ago, the Obama administration made major efforts to reach out to China.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to “being in the same boat,” and that China and the United States would “rise and fall together.”
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said he spent more time consulting his Chinese counterparts than those in any other country.
Some observers even referred to a US-Chinese “G2” that would manage the world economy.
The G2 idea was always foolish.
Europe has a larger economy than both the US and China, and Japan’s economy is currently about the same size as China’s.
Their participation in the solution of global problems will be essential.
Nonetheless, growing US-Chinese cooperation within the G20 last year was a positive sign of bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation.
Whatever the concerns regarding the recent events related to the Dalai Lama and Taiwan, it is important to note that the deterioration in US-Chinese relations began beforehand.
Many American congressmen, for example, complain that American jobs are being destroyed by China’s intervention in currency markets to maintain an artificially low value for the yuan.
A second issue was China’s decision not to cooperate at the United Nations conference on global climate change in Copenhagen last December.
Not only did China resist measures that had been under negotiation for the preceding year, but Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s decision to send a low-level official to meet with and point a finger at Obama was downright insulting.
China behaved similarly when the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (plus Germany) met to discuss sanctions against Iran for violations of its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Again, China sent a low-ranking official.
What happened to those promising early signs of cooperation?
Two reasons for the change in Chinese behavior – seemingly inconsistent at first glance, but in fact perhaps mutually reinforcing – seem possible.
First, a political transition is expected in 2012, and, in a period of rising nationalism, no Chinese leader wants to look softer than his rivals.
This helps to explain the recent crackdowns in Tibet and Xingjian, as well as the detention of human rights lawyers.
In addition, China may be approaching an economic transition.
Some Chinese argue that anything less than 8% growth would be inadequate to ensure sufficient job creation and fend off social instability.
But, as America’s savings rate begins to rise, China’s export-led growth model, which has promoted employment in China at the cost of global trade imbalances, may no longer be possible.
If China responds to entreaties to revalue the yuan, it may need to look tough on other issues to appease nationalist sentiment.
The second cause of China’s recent behavior could be hubris and overconfidence.
China is justly proud of its success in emerging from the world recession with a high rate of economic growth.
It blames the US for producing the recession, and now holds some $2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves.
Many Chinese believe that this represents a shift in the global balance of power, and that China should be less deferential to other countries, including the US.
Certain Chinese scholars are now writing about the decline of the US, with one identifying the year 2000 as the peak of American power.
This overconfidence in foreign policy, combined with insecurity in domestic affairs, may combine to explain the change in Chinese behavior in the latter part of 2009.
If so, China is making a serious miscalculation.
First, the US is not in decline.
Americans and others have been predicting decline regularly over the years: after the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957; again when Nixon closed the gold window in 1971; and when the American rust-belt economy seemed to be overtaken by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980’s.
But when one looks at the underlying strength of the American economy, it is not surprising that the World Economic Forum ranks the US second (just behind Switzerland) among the most competitive, while China ranks some 30 places below.
Second, the fact that China holds so many dollars is not a true source of power, because the interdependence in the economic relationship is symmetrical.
True, if China dumped its dollars on world markets, it could bring the American economy to its knees, but in doing so it would bring itself to its ankles.
China would not only lose the value of its dollar reserves, but would suffer major unemployment.
When interdependence is balanced, it does not constitute a source of power.
Third, despite Chinese complaints, the dollar is likely to remain the major global reserve currency, owing to the depth and breadth of America’s capital markets, which China cannot match without making the yuan fully convertible and reforming its banking system.
Finally, China has miscalculated by violating the wisdom of Deng Xiaoping, who advised that China should proceed cautiously and “keep its light under a basket.”
As a senior Asian statesman told me recently, Deng would never have made this mistake.
If Deng were in charge today, he would lead China back to the cooperative relations with the US that marked early 2009.
LONDON – I recently took two trips to China just as the government launched its 12th Five-Year Plan to rebalance the country’s long-term growth model.
My visits deepened my view that there is a potentially destabilizing contradiction between China’s short- and medium-term economic performance.
China’s economy is overheating now, but, over time, its current overinvestment will prove deflationary both domestically and globally.
Once increasing fixed investment becomes impossible – most likely after 2013 – China is poised for a sharp slowdown.
Instead of focusing on securing a soft landing today, Chinese policymakers should be worrying about the brick wall that economic growth may hit in the second half of the quinquennium.
Despite the rhetoric of the new Five-Year Plan – which, like the previous one, aims to increase the share of consumption in GDP – the path of least resistance is the status quo.
The new plan’s details reveal continued reliance on investment, including public housing, to support growth, rather than faster currency appreciation, substantial fiscal transfers to households, taxation and/or privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), liberalization of the household registration (hukou) system, or an easing of financial repression.
China has grown for the last few decades on the back of export-led industrialization and a weak currency, which have resulted in high corporate and household savings rates and reliance on net exports and fixed investment (infrastructure, real estate, and industrial capacity for import-competing and export sectors).
When net exports collapsed in 2008-2009 from 11% of GDP to 5%, China’s leader reacted by further increasing the fixed-investment share of GDP from 42% to 47%.
Thus, China did not suffer a severe recession – as occurred in Japan, Germany, and elsewhere in emerging Asia in 2009 – only because fixed investment exploded.
And the fixed-investment share of GDP has increased further in 2010-2011, to almost 50%.
The problem, of course, is that no country can be productive enough to reinvest 50% of GDP in new capital stock without eventually facing immense overcapacity and a staggering non-performing loan problem.
China is rife with overinvestment in physical capital, infrastructure, and property.
To a visitor, this is evident in sleek but empty airports and bullet trains (which will reduce the need for the 45 planned airports), highways to nowhere, thousands of colossal new central and provincial government buildings, ghost towns, and brand-new aluminum smelters kept closed to prevent global prices from plunging.
Commercial and high-end residential investment has been excessive, automobile capacity has outstripped even the recent surge in sales, and overcapacity in steel, cement, and other manufacturing sectors is increasing further.
In the short run, the investment boom will fuel inflation, owing to the highly resource-intensive character of growth.
But overcapacity will lead inevitably to serious deflationary pressures, starting with the manufacturing and real-estate sectors.
Eventually, most likely after 2013, China will suffer a hard landing.
All historical episodes of excessive investment – including East Asia in the 1990’s – have ended with a financial crisis and/or a long period of slow growth.
To avoid this fate, China needs to save less, reduce fixed investment, cut net exports as a share of GDP, and boost the share of consumption.
The trouble is that the reasons the Chinese save so much and consume so little are structural.
It will take two decades of reforms to change the incentive to overinvest.
Traditional explanations for the high savings rate (lack of a social safety net, limited public services, aging of the population, underdevelopment of consumer finance, etc.) are only part of the puzzle.
Chinese consumers do not have a greater propensity to save than Chinese in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan; they all save about 30% of disposable income.
The big difference is that the share of China’s GDP going to the household sector is below 50%, leaving little for consumption.
Several Chinese policies have led to a massive transfer of income from politically weak households to politically powerful companies.
A weak currency reduces household purchasing power by making imports expensive, thereby protecting import-competing SOEs and boosting exporters’ profits.
Low interest rates on deposits and low lending rates for firms and developers mean that the household sector’s massive savings receive negative rates of return, while the real cost of borrowing for SOEs is also negative.
This creates a powerful incentive to overinvest and implies enormous redistribution from households to SOEs, most of which would be losing money if they had to borrow at market-equilibrium interest rates.
Moreover, labor repression has caused wages to grow much more slowly than productivity.
To ease the constraints on household income, China needs more rapid exchange-rate appreciation, liberalization of interest rates, and a much sharper increase in wage growth.
More importantly, China needs either to privatize its SOEs, so that their profits become income for households, or to tax their profits at a far higher rate and transfer the fiscal gains to households.
Instead, on top of household savings, the savings – or retained earnings – of the corporate sector, mostly SOEs, tie up another 25% of GDP.
But boosting the share of income that goes to the household sector could be hugely disruptive, as it could bankrupt a large number of SOEs, export-oriented firms, and provincial governments, all of which are politically powerful.
As a result, China will invest even more under the current Five-Year Plan.
Continuing down the investment-led growth path will exacerbate the visible glut of capacity in manufacturing, real estate, and infrastructure, and thus will intensify the coming economic slowdown once further fixed-investment growth becomes impossible.
Until the change of political leadership in 2012-2013, China’s policymakers may be able to maintain high growth rates, but at a very high foreseeable cost.
2008 will not be remembered chiefly for noble or heroic acts.
Yet, amidst the news reports over the past few months of financial fraud, bloodshed in India and Gaza, and global economic disasters, one item stood out for its bravery and nobility.
On December 10, the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, more than 300 Chinese citizens, ranging from law professors to businessmen, farmers, and even some government officials, put their names to a remarkable document, entitled Charter 08.
The signatories, later joined by thousands more, asked where China was heading in the twenty-first century: “Will it continue with ‘modernization’ under authoritarian rule, or will it embrace universal human values, join the mainstream of civilized nations, and build a democratic system?” 
There is nothing incendiary about Charter 08, no call for violent rebellion, no thirst for revenge or retribution.
It merely asks for what citizens of all liberal democracies take for granted: the right to question government policies, protection of human rights, an independent judiciary, and multi-party elections.
The model for Charter 08 was Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77.
In 1977, several prominent signatories, such as Václav Havel, were arrested as a result.
Likewise, one of the bravest, most lucid Chinese intellectuals, Liu Xiaobo, was arrested in December for signing Charter 08, and has yet to be released.
Other signers have been interrogated and harassed.
Charter 08 has not received the attention it deserves, perhaps because most people have other, more pressing concerns.
But there is also a tendency, not only in China, to dismiss such calls for democracy as irrelevant, even misguided.
Recent American policies have given the promotion of democracy a bad name.
In China, and other remaining areas of Asian authoritarianism, it has become customary, even among some self-professed “liberals,” to argue that democracy may be fine for Europeans and Americans, but is unsuited to Asian conditions.
China is too big, its culture too different, and its population still too poor and uneducated to support a democratic system.
An alternative to this line of argument is to claim that China has its own kind of democracy, based on a Confucian idea of government benevolence and the Chinese people’s cultural propensity to sacrifice individual rights to collective goods.
To those who take this view – and on this point many Western businessmen are in complete agreement with the Chinese Communist Party – the signatories of Charter 08 are simply out of touch with their own culture.
In terms of its immediate impact, it is true that Charter 08 will hardly make a ripple in the pond of Chinese politics.
The government will not even discuss the Charter’s ideas, let alone do anything to implement them.
But this is no reason to call it irrelevant.
In 1977, few people would have predicted that Havel would one day preside over a Czech democracy.
He and his fellow dissidents were a tiny minority, too.
A liberal-democratic China may not come soon, but after Charter 08 no one can deny that many Chinese desperately want it.
The expression of this desire is especially important now that the world is gripped by a terrifying economic crisis.
Widespread economic distress is never without political consequences.
Xenophobic populism is on the rise in Europe.
President Barack Obama will have a difficult time curbing resentful protectionism in the United States.
Japanese might revert to angry nationalism.
Nowhere, however, are the political and social consequences of an economic slump more potentially destabilizing than in China.
This is because the Chinese Communist Party’s monopoly on power can be justified only by continued rapid economic growth, without which workers and farmers will lose their jobs, and the urban middle classes their chance of increasing prosperity.
The economic boom is the only source of legitimacy that the one-party state has left.
Few people, even Party members, still believe in Marxism-Leninism, let alone Maoism.
And the general discontent with official corruption and political oppression was amply demonstrated in all regions of China in 1989.
The Communist government managed to stay in power after Tiananmen not just through brute force.
A semblance of political legitimacy, especially among the educated middle class, was purchased with the promise of greater wealth.
As long as people felt that they were getting richer, demands for more freedom of speech, better protection of human rights, and the right to vote could be postponed.
But if this arrangement collapses, and increasing material prosperity can no longer be taken for granted, many things could happen – few of them pleasant.
Rural areas and industrial cities might explode in massive riots.
While the government might be able to crush such disturbances with force, a loss of confidence among the middle class would be more serious.
Militant nationalism, partly encouraged by nervous rulers, might be one consequence. Attempts by the military to stem unrest by taking control of government might be another.
If there were no alternative ideas to one-party authoritarianism, military rule, or nationwide chaos, the future of China would be very bleak indeed.
But there is an alternative. It has been set out eloquently and persuasively in Charter 08.
If China manages one day to follow the example of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, and join the “mainstream of civilized nations” by establishing a liberal democracy, then December 10, 2008, will go down in history as one of the key dates of its conception.
When China National Offshore Oil Company tried to buy America’s UNOCAL two years ago, it set off a political firestorm in the United States.
When Dubai Ports World bought Britain’s P&amp;O Steam Navigation Company, the fact that P&amp;O operated ports inside the US led to more controversy in America.
One would think that a country like the US, with a current account deficit of roughly $800 billion a year, would realize that such a yawning external gap is inevitably financed only by selling off assets, which means that foreigners with money acquire ownership and control of US-based businesses.
But the US – or at least Congress and the media – doesn’t get it.
Americans evidently hope for a world in which they can have feckless deficit-generating fiscal policies, a very low private savings rate, and a moderate rate of investment, all financed by foreign capital whose owners are happy to bear the risks yet have no control over their assets.
One might think that foreign investors would quake in terror at these terms and shy away from dollar-denominated assets.
But this has not been the case.
High oil prices have created huge export revenues for Middle Eastern governments, which still want to park their earnings in American assets.
The same is true of Russia, whose oligarchs, as well as the huge state investment fund that finance minister Alexi Kudrin has created, also want to invest their oil revenues in the US.
As for Asia’s governments, with China in the lead, the US remains the importer of last resort.
The key to their development strategy is to put migrants from the countryside to work making exports destined for the US market.
They doubt that an alternative development strategy based on boosting domestic demand would succeed.
Thus, the real values of their currencies must be kept low relative to the dollar, which means that their reserves now invested in the US must continue to grow.
Someday, of course, this will come to an end.
Perhaps Asian real currency values will rise sharply as a result of a burst of inflation in Asia.
Perhaps the dollar will collapse and there will be a burst of inflation in the US as the Federal Reserve Board decides that temporarily abandoning its price-level peg is a lesser evil than the unemployment fallout that will result from a dollar collapse and interest rate spike.
A government that buys political risk insurance by placing an ever-growing stock of reserve assets in dollar securities guards against some dangers.
But it is exposed to other risks, especially if it confines its investments to that slice of the asset pool, US Treasury and high-grade corporate bonds, that American politicians are comfortable having foreigners own.
Nominal bonds are not well hedged against inflation, and, over the long run, assets that are claims to cash without effective control are highly vulnerable to financial vultures.
Prudent foreign government and private investors would find some way to diversify.
But how?
Buying other countries’ bonds would mean abandoning the goal of keeping real currency values low against the dollar.
Buying up whole enterprises triggers angry speeches in the US Congress.
What are needed are intermediary organizations that will grant a measure of control to foreigners, allow diversification across a wider range of US-located assets, and yet still appear 100% American to US politicians.
Enter the Blackstone Group.
China’s $3 billion investment in Blackstone, while insignificant relative to China’s $1.3 trillion of reserve assets – a sum headed for $1.5 trillion by the end of this year and likely to hit $2 trillion sometime in 2009 – is but a toe dipped in the water, a test run.
At the start of the process, China will have small and indirect ownership stakes in a great many US enterprises, and the odds are that the usual objections will be absent.
China will gain a measure of risk diversification, reduce the price pressure that has kept earnings on its foreign exchange reserves low, and avoid running into political trouble.
Blackstone will gain extra cash to deploy and extra fees.
Some observers think that the US political backlash against foreigners “buying up America” is what will bring the current configuration of global imbalances to an end.
Deals like China’s investment in Blackstone postpone that backlash, but not for long: $3 billion is equivalent to what China accumulates in reserve in less than three working days.
The question following China’s Blackstone investment is this: how far can this process go?
And how much control will US investors ultimately find that they have given up?
CHENGDU – Last month saw the 50th anniversary of what Tibetan activists like to call Tibetan National Uprising Day, the day in 1959 when Tibetans in Lhasa revolted against Chinese Communist Party rule. The rebellion was crushed.
The Dalai Lama fled to India, and for at least a decade things became a lot worse: many Tibetans – possibly more than a million – starved to death during Chairman Mao’s Great Leap Forward campaign, temples and monasteries were smashed, sometimes by Tibetan Red Guards, during the Cultural Revolution, and a large number of people died in the violence.
Chinese officials are noticeably jumpy in this year of anniversaries (20 years after Tiananmen).
This March, I was in Chengdu, in Sichuan province, where many Tibetans live.
Even foreign tourists who had no clue about the anniversary were stopped in the streets by policemen looking for signs of rebellion.
The colorful Tibetan district was cordoned off.
Not only was it forbidden to take pictures there; one couldn’t even walk through.
The Chinese press, however, marked the anniversary with effusive articles describing Tibetan joy at being liberated from centuries of feudalism and slavery.
If the China Daily , among other publications, is to be believed, “pre-Liberation” Tibet was a living hell, and Tibetans are now happy and grateful to be citizens of the People’s Republic of China.
Some probably are.
Many are not.
But if Chinese propaganda paints too dark a picture of the Tibetan past, Westerners who sympathize with the Tibetan cause are often too sentimental.
The personal charm of the Dalai Lama, combined with the Himalayan air of superior spiritual wisdom, has promoted a caricature of a mystical, wise, and peace-loving people being crushed by a brutal empire.
It was not for nothing, however, that quite a few educated Tibetans actually welcomed the Chinese Communists in 1950.
The Buddhist clergy was seen, not without reason, as hidebound and oppressive.
Chinese Communism promised modernization.
And that is what China’s government delivered in the last few decades.
Lhasa, a sleepy, rather grubby backwater only 30 years ago, is now a city of huge public squares, shopping centers, and high-rise buildings, connected to the rest of China with a high-speed railway line.
It is true that Tibetans, sparsely represented in local government, may not have benefited as much as the Han Chinese, whose presence in cities, such as Lhasa, as soldiers, traders, and prostitutes is so overwhelming that people worry about the extinction of Tibetan culture, except as an official tourist attraction.
Still, there is no question that Tibetan towns are now more modern – in terms of electrification, education, hospitals, and other public facilities – than they were before.
This is one of the arguments used not only by Chinese officials, but by almost all Chinese, to justify Tibet’s absorption into greater China.
This argument has a long history.
Western (and, indeed, Japanese) imperialists used it in the early twentieth century to justify their “missions” to “civilize” or “modernize” the natives.
Taiwan, under Japanese rule, was in fact more modern than other parts of China.
And the British brought modern administration, as well as railways, universities, and hospitals, to India.
Outside a fringe of nostalgic chauvinists, however, most Europeans and Japanese are no longer so convinced that modernization is sufficient validation of imperial rule.
Modernization should be carried out by self-governing people, not imposed by foreign force.
Tibetans, in other words, should be allowed to modernize themselves.
But the Chinese have another argument up their sleeve, which seems more plausible (and more modern).
They are justly proud of the ethnic diversity of China.
Why should nationality be defined by language or ethnicity?
If Tibetans should be allowed to break away from China, why not the Welsh from Britain, the Basques from Spain, the Kurds from Turkey, or the Kashmiris from India?
In some cases, the answer might be: well, perhaps they should.
But ethnicity as the main marker of nationality is a vague and dangerous concept, not least because it leaves all minorities out in the cold.
So are people wrong to support the Tibetan cause?
Should we dismiss it as sentimental nonsense?
Not necessarily.
The issue is not so much Tibetan culture, or spirituality, or even national independence, but political consent.
In this respect, the Tibetans are no worse off than other citizens of the People’s Republic of China.
Historic monuments are being bulldozed everywhere in China in the name of development.
Culture is being sterilized, homogenized, and deprived of independence and spontaneity in all Chinese cities, not just in Tibet.
No Chinese citizen, regardless of whether he or she is Han, Tibetan, Uighur, or Mongolian, can vote the ruling party out of power.
The problem, then, is not mainly one of nationality or discrimination, but of politics.
The Chinese government claims that Tibetans are happy.
But, without a free press, and the right to vote, there is no way of knowing this.
Sporadic acts of collective violence, followed by equally violent oppression, suggest that many are not.
Without democratic reform there will be no end to this cycle, for violence is the typical expression of people without free speech.
This is true not only for Tibet, but also for the rest of China.
Tibetans will be free only when all Chinese are free.
In that sense, if in no other, all citizens of China hang together.
Ever since their reinvention by Pierre de Coubertin, the Olympic Games have always been politicized.
The first took place in 1896 in Athens in order to embarrass the Turks still occupying Northern Greece.
The Berlin Games in 1936 celebrated the triumph of Nazi ideology.
The Seoul Games in 1988 opened the door to South Korea’s democratization.
This summer’s Olympics in Beijing will be no less political, but will it resemble Berlin or Seoul?
Will it mark the apotheosis of an authoritarian regime or the beginning of its demise?
Many optimistic observers of China, often mollified by their close relations with the Communist regime, bet on a soft transition from despotism toward an open society, but recent events don’t support such a benign interpretation.
Since the beginning of this year, repression of human rights activists, lawyers, and bloggers has been harsher than ever.
The exact number of democratic dissidents who have been incarcerated, or worse, is unknown.
There is no way to account for ignored victims, or why some are condemned to death and shot.
We don’t know how many are sent without trial to “re-education centers.”
In the absence of reliable statistics, let us focus on two iconic figures of China’s pro-democracy movement: Hu Jia and Chen Guancheng.
Last December 27, 20 armed police officers used extreme physical violence to arrest Hu Jia in front of his wife and their two-month-old baby, acting as if he could offer real resistance.
But Hu Jia is a diminutive young man of 34 who suffers from a severe liver ailment.
Moreover, he is a committed believer in non-violence, an admirer of the Dalai Lama, a disciple of the Mahatma Gandhi, and a sincere Buddhist.
Why is the mighty Chinese Communist Party deploying all of its powers to kidnap – no word better describes what happened – such a tiny enemy?
The Party accuses him of “subversion,” but he broke no laws, does not head a counter-revolutionary army, and was not on the verge of toppling the Party.
Hu Jia’s political actions are much more modest than that.
In 2000, he abandoned his studies at Beijing University when he learned that thousands of Henan peasants were dying from AIDS after having sold their blood to local traffickers.
Since the beginning of this epidemic, his main activity has been the distribution of medicine and moral comfort in the doomed villages of Henan.
Hu Jia’s charitable work is not facilitated by the local authorities, who bear some responsibility in this epidemic; moreover, with NGOs being forbidden in China, Hu Jia can act only by himself.
Indeed, if he were to build any kind of organization to support his charity, he would be violating the law.
But the eye-opening tragedy of the Henan victims caused Hu Jia to understand that it arose from the absence of human rights in China.
So he started a Web site that acts as a chat room for Chinese scholars sharing his concern.
This Web site, now closed by the government, has also reported on the fate of Chen Guangcheng.
Chen, a blind peasant and self-taught lawyer, had protested in 2005 against the kidnapping of some 3000 women in his hometown of Linyi.
The women were sterilized or forced into having abortions in order to stabilize the population increase in the region.
As this extreme violence violates Chinese law, Chen petitioned the central government – the only legally recognized form of protest in China.
When carrying his petition to Beijing, escorted by a tiny group of lawyers, Chen was accused of disrupting traffic on the city’s clogged roads and condemned to four years in jail.
Why do such moderate actions, rooted in the Chinese moral tradition, provoke such dramatic repression?
Hu and Chen clearly respect the law.
They don’t call for revolution.
True enough, they talk to foreign journalists who report their actions; however, such contact is not illegal.
But the Party is haunted by the Soviet precedent.
No Chinese Sakharov or Solzhenitsyn will be allowed to tarnish the “success” of the Party.
The incarceration of Hu Jia and Chen Guangcheng is a clear signal that no democratization process will start in China outside of the Party’s control.
When the Chinese leaders mention democracy in official declarations, they mean “organized” democracy, from the top down.
Any attempt at democratization by civil society will thus be crushed in its infancy.
China is clearly not on the path toward a Western-style democracy, and economic growth will not be a prelude to a free society so long as the Party can prevent it.
The regime’s true ambition is to invent an alternative to Western democracy: an enlightened despotism under the tutelage of a meritocratic Communist Party.
The Olympic Games are being designed to promote this alternative model.
How legitimate is this model?
The Party’s 60 million members, nearly all males and city dwellers, would probably approve, as might the 200 million Chinese who share the profits of rapid economic growth.
But what do one billion people living in utter poverty (300 million on less than one dollar a day) and deprived of any rights think of this enlightened despotism?
No one knows, because they cannot express their wishes.
Perhaps Hu Jia and Chen Guancheng represent this silent billion more than the Party does.
That would explain why the Party has crushed them – and why any decent participant in this summer’s Olympics should demand their immediate release.
WASHINGTON, DC – During the state visit to the United States of Chinese President Hu Jintao, President Barack Obama pressed Hu on human rights. He probably should have asked more about spreading democracy in China, because he might have been surprised by what he heard.
In September 2010, Hu gave a speech in Hong Kong in which he called for new thinking about Chinese democracy.
He said, “There is a need to…hold democratic elections according to the law; have democratic decision-making, democratic management as well as democratic supervision; safeguard people’s right to know, to participate, to express, and to supervise.”
His remarks elaborated on previous comments by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, delivered in Shenzhen, the coastal free-enterprise zone where China’s economic revolution began.
Wen said that political reform, including opportunities for citizens to criticize and monitor the government, is necessary to sustain China’s breakneck economic growth.
Otherwise, he argued, the country’s economic gains would be lost.
Wen’s remarks led to speculation that Shenzhen, which set the pace for China’s economic development, could soon become a “special political zone.”
China experts noted that a next step could be direct elections for the chiefs of the Special Economic Zone’s six districts.
Most non-Chinese would be surprised to learn that the country already holds more elections than any other in the world.
Under the Organic Law of the Village Committees, all of China's approximately one million villages – home to roughly 600 million voters – hold local elections every three years.
Critics scoff that local Communist Party officials manipulate these elections.
But, according to research by Robert Benewick, a professor at the University of Sussex in England, village elections have been growing more competitive, with a greater number of independent candidates and increasing use of the secret ballot.
For those elections that have been genuinely competitive, researchers claim to have found evidence of positive effects.
For example, in a study that looked at 40 villages over 16 years, the economist Yao Yang found that the introduction of elections had led to increased spending on public services by 20%, while reducing spending on “administrative costs” – bureaucratese for corruption – by 18%.
And Wen has indicated that village elections might be extended to the next highest government level – township administrations – over the next few years.
China's modest experiments with local elections have been supplemented by exercises in “deliberative democracy.”
These take the form of high-tech town hall meetings.
Chinese officials hired Stanford University professor James Fishkin to draft a representative sample of citizens from Zeguo for an assembly using keypad polling devices and handheld computers to decide how the city should spend a $6 million public-works budget.
The Zeguo exercise was considered hugely successful, and has been replicated elsewhere in China.
Professor Yu Keping, an influential Communist official and author of a prominent book called Democracy Is a Good Thing, is said to have the ear of President Hu.
Professor Yu and others have been nudging democracy forward within the Communist Party itself.
Competitive elections for lower-level party posts have already been held, with votes for provincial and national party congresses showing electoral slates with 15-30% more candidates than positions.
Since the Communist Party has a membership of 73 million people, such a "democratic vanguard" holds great potential.
If internal elections become widespread, the lines of ideological disagreement within elite circles might become more clearly drawn, which could further spur calls for some kind of representative institutional structure.
Rapid change in China already has resulted in a battle of ideas, pitting the coasts and cities against the countryside and inland provinces, and the rich against the poor.
Of course, as Chinese democracy develops, it is unlikely to replicate the Western model.
Confucian-inspired intellectuals like Jiang Qing, for example, have put forward an innovative proposal for a tricameral legislature.
Legislators in one chamber would be selected on the basis of merit and competency, and in the others on the basis of elections of some kind.
One elected chamber might be reserved only for Communist Party members, the other for representatives elected by ordinary Chinese.
Such a tricameral legislature, its proponents believe, would better ensure that political decisions are made by more educated and enlightened representatives, thereby avoiding the rank populism of Western-style elected factions.
It is intriguing to contemplate China embracing some sort of innovative democratic experiment, combining tricameralism with deliberative democracy methods to mold a new separation of powers – and thus a new type of political accountability.
Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was quoted in 1987 as saying that there would be national elections in 50 years.
China’s democratic trajectory generates little fanfare, but it may actually deliver on Deng’s promise ahead of schedule.
China is notoriously secretive; its government mechanics inscrutable.
The constitution says that power belongs to the people, but in reality the rights of the people belong to the Communist Party and its leaders, from whom workers and peasants receive scant attention.
The CCP claims to have delivered a democratic revolution, but the country remains one of the world's most undemocratic.
So irreconcilable are these paradoxes that the 16th Party Congress that will convene next week cannot hope but to show itself as a democratic sham.
The highest party posts will change hands at the Congress, including the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, the General Secretary of the Party, and several Politburo Standing Committee members.
According to the CCP Charter, all of those positions (save the leadership of the Military Commission) should be determined by the votes of members of the 16th Central Committee.
The 16th Party Congress should in turn elect the 16th Central Committee, Party Congress representatives should be elected by each provincial party congress, and so on.
In fact, these elections will be characterized by opacity and the absence of any real democratic process.
Indeed, the only elections in China in which truly independent voters choose candidates occur at the village committee level, but this democratic mummery is staged mainly for the benefit of outside observers.
All other Chinese elections share two main characteristics: candidates are selected to preserve party leaders, and the leaders decide the number of candidates.
China holds two types of election: "equal quota elections" and "differential quota elections."
In equal quota elections, the leaders present three candidates, leaving voters the task of picking one.
This is a sacred rule of Chinese politics, one that is considered entirely legitimate.
In the past 50 years, all "elected" officials, including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, were designated in ways that delivered the illusion of choice but without the element of uncertainty.
After the Cultural Revolution, and despite widespread protest, "differential quota elections" were introduced, albeit in a limited fashion.
The 13th Party Congress, in tune with the rising democratic sentiments of the time, was the first to use the differential system for electing members of the Central Committee.
This constituted a breakthrough in party tactics.
By presenting voters with more candidates than positions, Deng Liqun, a member of the ultra-left Old Guard, was denied a seat.
Deng Xiaoping, at that time the paramount leader, and Chen Yun, another representative of the powerful Old Guard, were furious at this result.
Of course, no one, even in China, thinks of differential quota elections as being truly democratic.
All the candidates remain handpicked by the leadership, even if the least popular figures can be removed.
In the event, the differential system was a short-lived experiment.
Since 1989 the Party has relentlessly consolidated its central leadership, internal party democracy has been suppressed and voting procedures have actually degenerated.
The Party Congress has its origins in the mass gatherings and propaganda campaigns of the Mao era, and can bring together as many as two thousand delegates.
The First and Second Party Congresses had only a few dozen representatives, who possessed the power to question the party's highest officials.
That sort of accountability is long gone.
During its half-century in power, the CCP has developed a method called da hui xiao kai (big conference held small), which breaks the Congress down into myriad small-group sessions.
The forthcoming 16th Party Congress will be comprised of these small-group sessions.
None will have a clear mandate, and any debate will be emasculated.
Delegates are confused about their roles and powers, and the conditions are perfect for creating a silent majority.
Each session is like an afternoon tea party where representatives offer random reflections, praise the correctness of the leadership's reports and attempt to show how conscientiously they have studied them and how deeply they comprehend them.
The suggestions raised by representatives at tea parties are never made a subject for debate by the Congress as a whole.
Instead they are given to the staff members of the Secretariat to "process."
Some minor revisions to the final report might be made, but the procedures of a real parliamentary democracy-proposal, debate, and resolution-remain absent.
The grave realities that confront China-for example, corruption and the ever-widening social gap-will not be raised as matters for debate.
CCP members will never get the chance to address any concerns that they may hold before a wide audience.
They will not get to discuss the protection of citizen's rights, relaxation of harsh media controls, the rights of peasants to migrate or take up jobs in the cities, or whether to tolerate workers who organize independent unions.
So how important will this 16th Party Congress be?
It certainly will not provide a forum for debating any of the long awaited, urgently needed, and unavoidable political reforms that China must launch.
By rescheduling it for November (apparently Jiang Zemin had double-booked himself by promising to travel to Texas to stay with President Bush on his Crawford ranch), the 16th Party Congress, at which the next generation of China's leaders will be anointed, may play second fiddle to a diplomatic visit.
CAMBRIDGE – When will China finally realize that it cannot accumulate dollars forever?
It already has more than $2 trillion.
Do the Chinese really want to be sitting on $4 trillion in another five to 10 years?
With the United States government staring at the long-term costs of the financial bailout, as well as inexorably rising entitlement costs, shouldn’t the Chinese worry about a repeat of Europe’s experience from the 1970’s?
During the 1950’s and 1960’s, Europeans amassed a huge stash of US Treasury bills in an effort to maintain fixed exchange-rate pegs, much as China has done today.
Unfortunately, the purchasing power of Europe’s dollars shriveled during the 1970’s, when the costs of waging the Vietnam War and a surge in oil prices ultimately contributed to a calamitous rise in inflation.
Perhaps the Chinese should not worry.
After all, the world leaders who just gathered at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh said that they would take every measure to prevent such a thing from happening again.
A key pillar of their prevention strategy is to scale back “global imbalances,” a euphemism for the huge US trade deficit and the corresponding trade surpluses elsewhere, not least China.
The fact that world leaders recognize that global imbalances are a huge problem is welcome news.
Many economists, including myself, believe that America’s thirst for foreign capital to finance its consumption binge played a critical role in the build-up of the crisis.
Cheap money from abroad juiced an already fragile financial regulatory and supervisory structure that needed discipline more than cash.
Unfortunately, we have heard leaders – especially from the US – claim before that they recognized the problem.
In the run-up to the financial crisis, the US external deficit was soaking up almost 70% of the excess funds saved by China, Japan, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and all the countries with current-account surpluses combined.
But, rather than taking significant action, the US continued to grease the wheels of its financial sector.
Europeans, who were called on to improve productivity and raise domestic demand, reformed their economies at a glacial pace, while China maintained its export-led growth strategy.
It took the financial crisis to put the brakes on US borrowing train – America’s current-account deficit has now shrunk to just 3% of its annual income, compared to nearly 7% a few years ago.
But will Americans’ newfound moderation last?
With the US government currently tapping financial markets for a whopping 12% of national income (roughly $1.5 trillion), foreign borrowing would be off the scale but for a sudden surge in US consumer and corporate savings.
For the time being, America’s private sector is running a surplus that is sufficient to fund roughly 75% of the government’s voracious appetite.
But how long will US private sector thrift last?
As the economy normalizes, consumption and investment will resume.
When they do – and assuming that the government does not suddenly tighten its belt (it has no credible plan to do so) – there is every likelihood that America’s appetite for foreign cash will surge again.
Of course, the US government claims to want to rein in borrowing.
But, assuming the economy must claw its way out of recession for at least another year or two, it is difficult to see how the government can fulfill its Pittsburgh pledge.
Yes, the Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy.
But they will not worry too much about the next financial crisis when the aftermath of the current one still lingers.
In our new book This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , Carmen Reinhart and I find that if financial crises hold one lesson, it is that their aftereffects have a very long tail.
Any real change in the near term must come from China, which increasingly has the most to lose from a dollar debacle.
So far, China has looked to external markets so that exporters can achieve the economies of scale needed to improve quality and move up the value chain.
But there is no reason in principle that Chinese planners cannot follow the same model in reorienting the economy to a more domestic-demand-led growth strategy.
Yes, China needs to strengthen its social safety net and to deepen domestic capital markets before consumption can take off.
But, with consumption accounting for 35% of national income (compared to 70% in the US!), there is vast room to grow.
Chinese leaders clearly realize that their hoard of T-Bills is a problem.
Otherwise, they would not be calling so publicly for the International Monetary Fund to advance an alternative to the dollar as a global currency.
They are right to worry.
A dollar crisis is not around the corner, but it is certainly a huge risk over the next five to 10 years.
China does not want to be left holding a $4 trillion bag when it happens.
It is up to China to take the lead on the post-Pittsburgh agenda.
BEIJING: New Economy euphoria is gripping China.
Cell phones seem as ubiquitous in Shanghai as in Helsinki, with dot com firms as common as in San Francisco.
Although the term “irrational exuberance,” once applied by America’s central banker Alan Greenspan to the US stock market, does not apply here, the rush into New Economy investments, with even the prospect of a Chinese NASDAQ in the offing, has rejuvenated China’s economy.
As China embraces the new, however, its old industries are coming under enormous pressure.
Coming just a few years after Asia’s financial panic, China’s euphoria is surprising.
The government seems to be embracing the New Economy as a means to immunize China against future crisis.
This is wishful thinking.
No one should expect that a single crisis can burn away all of a country’s economic weeds, nor that the New Economy is a magic bullet for risk-free growth.
Over the past two centuries the developed world experienced periodic booms and busts on its way to prosperity.
Those crises purged economies and societies of inefficiencies and helped improve their core institutions.
The miracle of East-Asia (including China) over the past 30-40 years was not high growth alone but the fact that robust long term growth came about without inciting any major crisis.
Asia’s financial panic of 1997-1999 was a first for the region - which is why it stunned everyone - but it won’t be the last.
Despite all the hype, the New Economy cannot vaccinate a country from tumult.
So, in the wake of New Economy euphoria, are China’s technological ambitions and current growth rates sustainable?
Like some other Asian economies, China saw strong growth in the first half of 2000.
GDP grew by 8.2%, higher than last year’s 7.4% for the same period.
Moreover, three years of price deflation - which began during the financial crisis of 1997 - may be at an end.
As in America at the beginning of its boom, however, the key to continuing growth is sustained investment and improved productivity.
Investment in China has been growing steadily since the beginning of this year.
Even more hopeful is the fact that private (non-governmental) investment has recovered from last years’ decline to a moderate 6.7% growth in real term.
This growth is the first improvement in the investment climate for 3 years.
Although the New Economy is sometimes credited with these improvements, the real causes are more prosaic, which is why today’s momentum can be maintained.
Real structural adjustment occurred over the past 3-4 years: 16 millions state workers and 11 million others were laid off in urban and rural industries.
Many enterprises were closed, not only small State owned enterprises (SOEs), but also countless private and semi-private companies that were even more vulnerable than the SOEs to an economic slow-down.
Manufacturing capacity has been slashed in some industries, making room for new investment.
If private investment continues at its present pace, the government may be able to shelve its plans to stimulate investment through large-scale debt-financing, which will help sustain growth over the long run.
Increased domestic consumption is also pushing China’s economy ahead.
Although the retail price index remains negative, retail sales increased 13.8% in the second quarter.
The most notable trend is an escalating demand for housing.
Reform of housing laws, the opening of a secondary housing market, and in particular, the rapid expansion in the use of home mortgages are the main forces behind this growth.
This trend will likely continue to play a big role over the next decade as China’s 200million strong middle class sets out to become real property owners.
Beyond housing, exports and imports grew powerfully, by 38.3% and 36.2% respectively so far this year, thanks to expansion in the world economy and Asia’s recovery.
Not too much weight should be given to this, however, as exports only contributed 0.3% to GDP growth.
Entry by China into the WTO may temporarily boost exports, but the dismantling of China’s own trade barriers will increase imports quickly.
This means that China’s domestic market must become the focus of policymaking for growth.
As a developing country with a per capita GDP of $800, sharing similarities with other South-East Asian economies and (at the same time!) a “transition economy” bearing the burden of central planning, China’s domestic economy is a place riddled with economic, institutional, structural, and political problems.
Because China is saddled with both transition and developing country difficulties, finding solutions for these problems is more demanding here than in societies that are either purely transitional or developing.
This is another reason why Chinese policymakers must not jump on the New Economy bandwagon as an attempt to leap magically out of their problems into some utopian future.
China has seen enough experimentation over the last half-century to know that when you attempt a great leap forward you land flat on your face.
For China, today’s increasing growth rates are sustainable if China continues to open its economy to competition with the world while ruthlessly excising the legacy of socialist industrialization.
If such policies are pursued, Chinese growth may remain in the range of 7.5- 8%, with low inflation continuing for the foreseeable future.
It is only by keeping its eyes on its untrendy old economy that China’s New Economy ambitions make any sense.
China’s abrupt decision to raise the value of the renminbi (yuan) by 2.1% and to end its peg to the dollar comes after months of pressure from the US.
But the revaluation is likely to be a one-time affair and the free floating of the renminbi is probably not real because a stable currency is very much in China’s interest.
Indeed, the economist Robert Mundell, whose work on optimal monetary zones is credited with laying the theoretical groundwork for the euro, insists that China should maintain its fixed exchange rate as a necessary part of its current phase of economic development.
But, owing to China’s skewed economic structure, its exchange-rate regime presents much more challenging problems than those encountered by Japan and other East Asian economies.
Pegged exchange rates clearly have been essential to East Asia’s economic takeoff, for they work well with the region’s export-oriented development model.
But the effectiveness of a fixed exchange rate is determined by how developments in the export sector influence domestic industries and the national economy as a whole.
If growth in the trade sector boosts that of domestic non-trade sectors, then a fixed exchange rate will not put pressure on the external balance of payments as demand for imports rises.
Under these circumstances, revaluation of the exchange rate will not have a severe impact on an economy’s development.
For example, Japanese economists argue that the  Plaza Agreement, which called for “orderly appreciation” of non-dollar currencies against the dollar, was a natural outgrowth of high national income.
This was one of the major reasons for Japan’s acceptance of the change.
But China’s current situation is vastly different.
Pressure for revaluation comes at a stage when per capita national income is merely $1,000, not $10,000 or $15,000, so China still needs a rather long period of rapid economic growth to reach anything like the stage that Japan had achieved when it allowed the yen to be revalued.
Equally important, unlike other East Asian economies during their early take-off stages, the expansion of China’s export sector in the last decade has not been closely linked to the development of its domestic non-trade sector, because the expansion has been fueled mainly by foreign direct investment (FDI).
Most of China 460,000 foreign-owned enterprises are concentrated in manufacturing and assembling, increasing the import-intensiveness of exports and de-linking the external-trade sector from domestic industries.
This helps to widen regional disparities, especially between eastern and western China, with the wealthiest regions being those that have benefited from high concentrations of FDI.
No one should realistically expect the renminbi’s exchange rate to be determined solely by the income level of the relatively prosperous eastern coastal regions.
To be sure, China has accumulated an enormous balance-of-payments surplus, which indicates that the renminbi is greatly undervalued.
But the surplus merely masks the structural problems of China’s domestic economic sectors and poorer regions.
Indeed, if foreign-owned enterprises exports are deducted from the total trade volume, the surplus vanishes, because both the overall balance of merchandise trade and the balance of trade in services normally run deficits.
In short, the isolation of the export sector from the rest of China’s economy, caused by the dominance of FDI, accounts for the illusion of an undervalued renminbi.
Although the expansion of exports has been dramatic, now accounting for 70% of China’s GDP, it has exerted no pull on other economic sectors, because it has been confined to foreign-owned manufacturing and assembling enterprises.
With its huge domestic economy, China would never have been able to accumulate such an enormous external surplus if its growth had not been confined to such enterprises.
Pressure for revaluation stems, therefore, not from the real needs of China economy, but from large imbalances in the United States, particularly its long-standing trade deficit, which exceeds 5% of GDP.
However, dollar supremacy means that the US can sustain a much wider balance-of-payments deficit than other countries.
As long as Asia holds its foreign reserves in dollars  China’s desire to maintain a stable value for the reminbi will continue to offer tremendous advantages for trade and economic development.
MUNICH – Because China has pegged its undervalued currency, the renminbi, to the dollar, every weakening of the dollar in the wake of America’s financial crisis has also meant a weakening of the renminbi vis-à-vis other world currencies.
But is China really to blame for the eruption of a global currency war?
The central banks of South Korea, Brazil, Taiwan, Japan, Switzerland, and many other countries are now buying dollars in order to protect their own currencies against revaluation and thus to defend their exports.
Europe also became nervous after the euro exchange rate rose to more than $1.40, far beyond the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate of $1.17.
The United States is now taking drastic steps against China, and is making provisions for a trade war.
Congress has authorized the President to impose import duties on Chinese products if China remains unwilling to increase the value of its currency substantially against the dollar.
But the undervaluation of the renminbi, which is currently 45%, has persisted for many years.
So why is the US suddenly acting so aggressively?
Why didn’t America take action much earlier?
The reason lies in capital movements.
The US accepted the lower valuation of the renminbi as long as China returned the dollars that it earned from bilateral merchandise trade by financing America’s budget deficit.
Now that the Chinese prefer to invest that money in raw materials in Africa and elsewhere, they have aroused the full ire of American policymakers.
China’s shift has been dramatic.
In 2008 and 2009, the Chinese purchased US government bonds at a rate of $17 billion a month.
But China reversed course in November 2009.
During the first seven months of 2010, China not only refrained from buying any more US government paper, but even began to sell its holdings.
Each month, China sold a net sum of about $7 billion in US government bonds.
That nerves are now on end in America is perfectly understandable.
The City of London has jumped into the breach, increasing its purchases, which in 2008 and 2009 amounted to only about $1 billion monthly, to an average of $28 billion in the first seven months of this year.
Since the United Kingdom itself is a large capital importer, we can assume that the City is not holding the paper itself but merely restructuring it and then selling it to the world under a new name and with the London stamp on it.
Despite its withdrawal from financing the US government, China remains the world’s largest net capital exporter, a position that it has held since 2006.In2007 and 2008, China exported on average about $400 billion of capital annually.
The US, which at the time needed annual capital imports of $800 billion in order to offset the near total cessation of private savings, received the lion’s share of this capital.
The unwillingness of the Chinese to consume enabled Americans to build new houses for many years on borrowed money and to maintain a level of consumption that the US economy was unable to finance on its own.
To be sure, the Chinese always restrained themselves from private real-estate financing in the US.
They bought only government paper and securitized real-estate instruments that were issued by the semi-public bodies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Direct real-estate finance via private channels came mainly from other countries – Germany, for example.
Nevertheless, China helped the US to achieve a higher standard of living by making money available to government authorities that would otherwise have had to come from American taxpayers.
Given this history, it is a bit shabby to reproach China now for its exchange-rate policy – a policy that enabled the US to live beyond its means for so long.
Rather than coming at the expense of the US, as is constantly claimed, it was the renminbi’s low valuation that allowed Americans to dream their American dream of universal homeownership.
Imports of inexpensive Chinese products freed up capital and labor in the US for a dramatic expansion of the housing stock – which led to a sharp rise in the American standard of living.
It is understandable that the Chinese are now reluctant to invest more money in the US.
They tried to enter the US energy market with the purchase of Unocal, but were blocked by politicians.
Other direct investments were also stopped by Congress on the pretext of national security.
One need only recall the bidding for Emcore or Firstgold.
The US wanted the Chinese money, but it was not prepared to offer anything more than structured securities of questionable creditworthiness, as well as government paper that is now clearly exposed to the risk of inflation and devaluation.
It would be a service to world peace if the US stopped making cheap moral accusations against China.
The truth is much more subtle than naked political interest.
Europeans are wrong to be angry with China because its currency peg to the US dollar has boosted the euro against most currencies on foreign exchange markets.
On the contrary, they should view the currency peg as a valuable gift.
In New York and other American cities, European shoppers are on a spree.
They’re enjoying first hand the euro’s enhanced purchasing power abroad.
The currency peg has also helped make the euro into an important reserve currency, rivaling the dollar.
Investments from all over the world are flowing into Europe as a result.
It was predictable that China’s currency peg would have this effect.
It forced China to accumulate huge amounts of dollars to stabilize its currency and gave the euro an extra boost as the dollar depreciated.
To protect itself from the declining greenback, China and other countries are converting a portion of their accumulated dollar reserves into euros.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that the euro’s share of foreign exchange reserves rose to 26.4 percent in third quarter of 2007 from 25.5 percent in the second quarter of 2007, and 24.4 percent in the third quarter of 2006.
The euro’s becoming a major reserve currency bestows important economic advantages on the euro-zone economy.
Europeans should thank the Chinese currency peg for the part it is playing in this.
Of course, with an augmented supply of euros, China can be expected to make substantial investments in Europe, which also is a good thing, especially since, in the United States at least, China has demonstrated a preference for investments in financial institutions rocked by the sub-prime crisis.
Europe has plenty of those.
So far, China’s biggest European investment has been in the Belgian financial company, Fortis N.V., where Ping An Insurance recently acquired a 4.2% stake, making it the largest shareholder in the company.
China Development Bank also made an investment in Barclays to bolster its bid for ABN AMRO which, though it failed, helped the Dutch bank get the full value for its assets.
This is only a start.
Merrill Lynch predicts that, as currency reserves climb in countries like China, state-run investment funds will grow to $7.9 trillion, from $1.9 trillion now.
China’s currency peg has also come in handy for Europe in its fight to keep inflation in check, while its monetary policy remains constrained by the sub-prime crisis.
Experts estimate that, in terms of guarding against inflation, the euro’s appreciation has been equivalent to about 35 basis points rise in the interest rate.
The strong euro has helped insulate Europe from skyrocketing oil and commodity prices, which are priced in dollars on the world markets.
The big downside of the currency peg for Europe is supposed to be exports.
That’s what sent French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other high-level European officials scurrying off to China last November—and why many ordinary Europeans continue to think of the Chinese as not playing by the rules.
This is protectionist thinking par excellence. What makes exports so special?
Why are they more important than cheap imports or the bargains that European shoppers get in New York?
Should Europe give up all the advantages of the currency peg just because it makes European exports more expensive?
Of course not!
Note that it was French President Sarkozy who went to China to protest the currency peg, not German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
German exports are not being substantially damaged by the strong euro—indeed, German costs are so competitive that exporters are confident they can cope with the euro at 1.50 dollars and even higher.
This is not true for France&#45;&#45; but the answer is obvious: reduce costs and France too will be able to cope with the strong euro.
In the final analysis, cutting costs is all the Europeans can do if they want to preserve the competitiveness of their exports.
The Chinese are not going to change their exchange rate regime, which has strategic as well as economic motivations, just because the Europeans are unhappy with the currency peg.
China has given the Europeans a gift.
They should be grateful, rather than foolishly insist that China take it back.
Contrary to popular wisdom, Chinese efforts to control the Internet and other new media are not doomed to fail.
China's government has lost much control over the information and images that now circulate through Chinese society, but it still is capable of preventing any serious challenger from using the media to attack it.
How can this be?
The government demands that Web sites, television programs, and other media meet three general criteria:
They must support, or at least not hinder, China's efforts to sustain economic growth, maintain social order, unify with Taiwan, and secure international respect;
They must support, or at least not question, the Chinese Communist Party's monopoly on political power; and
They must oppose such "negative" social phenomena as "spiritual pollution" (for example, pornography and drug abuse), "bourgeois liberalization" (Western-style democratization), "feudal superstition" (the Falun Gong and other proscribed religions), and "worship of things foreign" (especially American popular culture).
The government's tools for enforcing these criteria are far more effective than most observers realize.
First, it can imprison those who violate its media policy.
For example, in 1998 it sentenced a Shanghai engineer to two years in prison for selling 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to an overseas-based dissident newsletter.
In March 2001, it launched a general crackdown on Internet dissent that resulted in numerous people being imprisoned and harassed.
Second, the government can use technical means to deny people access to undesired content.
It has jammed Voice of America broadcasts since June 1989 and in the spring of 2001 began jamming Tibetan-, Uighur-, and Kazakh-language broadcasts from India and Central Asia.
It blocks Chinese Internet surfers from visiting a list of banned Web sites and late last summer it blocked access to the Google and AltaVista search engines.
More recently, it developed a new system that allows surfers to access some sections of formerly banned sites, but deploys packet-sniffing technology to deny access to other sections.
Third, the government enlists cooperation from foreign businesses in exchange for exclusive access to China's gigantic market.
Just as the government persuaded Rupert Murdoch to remove BBC News from STAR-TV in 1994, it convinced Yahoo this year to design a special search engine for China that screens out Web sites dealing with unacceptable subjects.
Companies such as Cisco have been accused of providing the government with advanced technologies designed to make the "Great Internet Firewall" leak-proof.
Fourth, the government distracts attention by supporting "healthy" Chinese Web sites, as well as glitzy but vacuous entertainment-oriented TV programs.
Such circuses--combined with the bread of economic growth--crowds out subversive messages from abroad, especially when combined with nationalistic propaganda designed to inoculate people against whatever subversive media content that might slip through.
So far, China's government has succeeded famously in meeting technological advances that strengthen society with technological advances that strengthen the state.
Nor do Chinese and foreign business people clamor for change.
They don't need to read or hear about the Falun Gong and human rights to make sound investment or purchasing decisions.
All of this suggests that China might evolve into the kind of society whose members spend so much time and money on conspicuous consumption and diversionary entertainment that they lack the psychic energy to reflect upon the issues of freedom, equality, religion, and human rights.
Problems fester in such a society, but don't necessarily explode.
As long as the middle class supports state repression, order can be upheld.
The hope for more liberal democratic change in China seems to lie in a conflict between the rising middle class, rallying on both its own behalf and that of the poor, and the authoritarian state.
Journalists, intellectuals, and entrepreneurs reportedly chafe at government efforts to block access to overseas search engines; one day they might demand freedom of speech more generally.
But nowadays most members of the middle class seem content to exchange complacency for economic growth.
If they become unhappy, they can always console themselves with a pirated DVD.
Some groups, nonetheless, are fighting for the global freedom of the Internet.
One Chinese Internet hacker group, called "Hacktivismo," is researching the development of a technology called "Six-Four" (named after the date of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre) that would allow Chinese netizen s to use the Internet to communicate free from government observation and thus visit banned Web sites safely.
But even in a best-case scenario, these technologies won't be available for many months, if not years, and few people in China are likely to have the desire or ability to use them.
Sadly, China's government has demonstrated amazing adeptness at controlling the Internet in the face of daunting technological challenges--at least to the point of preventing a hard core of sensitive subjects from being discussed openly.
This situation will not change inevitably.
Those who assert that China is on the wrong side of history in its communication policies--and that the Internet means eventual democratization--ought to temper their optimism.
In China, history often takes a very long time.
BEIJING – China’s Henan province has a population of about 100 million – larger than that of most countries.
In China’s administrative system, a province is at the highest level of sub-national government, followed by counties, cities, and townships.
But a township in Guangdong province can easily serve a population of 500,000 to one million – larger than that of many cities outside of China.
Thus, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of regional issues – particularly inter-regional disparities – for China’s politics.
China is divided by nature.
Among the large continental countries, including India and Brazil, only China has a small segment of coastline but vast interior regions.
When the main object of human consumption was food, this was not a problem, because what mattered was land and water.
But in modern industrial, urban, and market-based societies, what may matter increasingly are transport costs, which means that geography can cause deep regional inequalities.
Though such disparities can, of course, have other causes as well, geography does seem to explain a lot.
First of all, it explains why China’s coastal regions developed earlier and faster after the country launched its market reforms and opened to the world.
It was not “preferential” policies or skewed resource allocation by the government that caused China’s coastal cities to boom, but rather their proximity to the ocean, which was and remains the cheapest way to move resources and products.
China may have more and larger high-tech and service industries – sectors that do not depend so heavily on transport – in the future.
But, as China grows increasingly dependent on imports of resource commodities to meet its basic needs, its coast will continue to enjoy a transport-cost advantage.
Thus, regional disparities in terms of economic prosperity may never narrow; indeed, they could often widen.
Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province in the west, might never catch up with Suzhou, a well-known manufacturing base near Shanghai.
China’s effort to develop more evenly, despite the permanent in-built advantages of the coast, takes the form of two-way traffic in capital and labor between coastal and interior regions.
Financial transfers flow from the coast to interior regions, via government fiscal allocation or other mechanisms, to improve infrastructure, including transport.
Such investments may not be as profitable as in other regions, but they should be regarded as public goods intended to equalize conditions for growth.
China’s central government has attempted this for the past 10 years through its “Western Development Program.”
Of course, the government’s efforts alone cannot entice industrial investors to “go West,” because public infrastructure spending cannot overcome all problems.
Without a road, you cannot transport resources and finished goods.
But, even with a road, you still must pay for tolls, gasoline, fleet maintenance, and other costs – and it can still take five days to get your goods to the coast if you want to export.
The other “traffic” may, in some ways, be even more important.
This is the labor that flows in the opposite direction, from west to east, promoting the only economic equality a country can ever achieve – equality of per capita income, not of GDP.
A coastal city that produces more GDP and boasts higher productivity and wages will attract more people to share in its prosperity until “marginal productivity” decreases.
As some people migrate to the coast, fewer people will share the interior regions’ resources, causing their per capita income to increase.
This is why mobility is so important to achieving greater social equality.
Most developed countries underwent great domestic migrations as they modernized, with 80% of their populations eventually re-allocated to coastal regions.
China is experiencing this process now.
If China’s authorities continue to encourage domestic migration, the problem of regional disparities will eventually be solved.
The same could be said of the global North-South disparity.
Some people used to argue that as long as one factor of production – i.e., capital – could move freely, the world could be equalized.
But I believe that other factors are also essential One-factor mobility may work well in a theoretical model, but in the dynamic real world, if the income gap cannot be narrowed rapidly enough, conditions that serve to enlarge the gap – such as unfavorable geography – may come to dominate.
This will sustain, if not deepen, global disparities, especially given northern countries’ unwillingness to allow free international migration.
The good news for China now is that the new national Five-Year Plan for 2010-2015 calls for the government not only to encourage domestic migration between regions, but also to improve the conditions for rural people to move and settle in the cities.
The infamous “Hukou” system (the resident registration system that restricts migration) may not be abolished overnight, but will be phased out step by step.
Of course, migration and urbanization will produce social problems and conflict.
But these have occurred in every country at China’s current stage of development, and China, too must go through it.
Otherwise, the country will remain divided forever.
For a decade, the world has wondered when China’s leaders will recognize the staggering environmental crisis confronting their country.
This year, we got an answer: a new Five-Year Plan that makes environmental protection a priority.
A storm of green propaganda has followed, and the government now talks about using “Green GDP” to measure development.
But will all this talk amount to real progress?
While the central government admits to some of the environmental degradation caused by rapid economic growth, the picture it paints is incomplete.
Consider “Green GDP.”
This spring, the State Environmental Protection Administration produced the country’s first official estimate of GDP adjusted downward for environmental losses.
According to these calculations, it would cost $84 billion to clean up the pollution produced in 2004, or 3% of GDP for that year.
But more realistic estimates put environmental damage at 8-13% of China’s GDP growth each year, which means that China has lost almost everything it has gained since the late 1970’s due to pollution.
China’s environmental problems, complex as the causes may be, can ultimately be attributed to our understanding of Marxism.
For most of our recent history, we saw in Marxism only a philosophy of class struggle.
We believed that economic development would solve all our problems.
In the reform period, this misreading of Marx morphed into an unrestrained pursuit of material gain devoid of morality.
Traditional Chinese culture, with its emphasis on harmony between human beings and nature, was thrown aside.
As a result, China’s economy is dominated by resource-hungry and inefficient polluters, such as coal and mineral mines, textile and paper mills, iron and steel makers, petrochemical factories, and building material producers.
Our cities are exploding in size, depleting water resources and creating horrific traffic congestion.
One-quarter of China’s people drink substandard water; one-third of urbanites breathe badly polluted air.
Moreover, the country recently witnessed a spate of environmental accidents.
Indeed, on average, China suffers a major water pollution accident every other day.
Although China has signed the Kyoto Protocol and some 50 other international environmental accords, we do little to honor them.
If we are not serious about upgrading our industrial structure, we will fail when it comes time to fulfill our commitments to cut emissions.
And while the new Five-Year Plan sets fine goals, many provinces have failed even to meet the major environment protection targets of the last Five-Year Plan.
True, China has made the kind of economic advances in three decades that required 100 years in Western countries.
But China also has suffered a century’s worth of environmental damage in 30 years.
Unfortunately, unlike Western countries, we cannot afford to wait until our per capita annual GDP reaches $10,000 before tackling our environmental problems.
Our experts predict that the environmental crisis will intensify to a critical stage by the time China’s per capita annual GDP reaches just $3,000.
Making matters worse, while we discarded the finer elements of our traditional culture, we failed to absorb the better aspects of modern civilization.
The concept of a “social contract” based on rights and obligations – the essential values that constitute the most important precondition for effective environmental protection – goes largely ignored.
As a result, environmental protection projects often fail to be included in calculating production costs.
Scarcely anyone bothers to consider the environmental costs to – or rights of – the country’s poor and powerless.
It is imperative that environmental factors figure in China’s macroeconomic planning in a real way.
This requires that a more rational strategy be mapped out in the planning of major industrial projects and energy-hungry enterprises.
Careful studies need to be done to determine available energy, land, mineral, and biological resources before projects proceed.
Land planning must be overhauled, with industrial monopolies broken up and development goals set according to population, resource volume, and the capacity to absorb pollution.
Finally, China needs a new energy strategy.
Industrialized nations have developed and made great use of nuclear, solar, wind, and bio-gas, and other renewable energy resources.
China’s technological capacities in this sector lag behind even other developing nations such as India and Pakistan, and its reliance on coal is one of the greatest threats to the global climate.
For now, there is simply no alternative.
But in the long run, clean energy will be the only way to bring economic growth without doing irreparable environmental damage.
Government cannot solve these problems on its own.
China’s people have the biggest stake in environmental protection, and so must become the driving force.
Local communities, non-governmental organizations, and businesses all must do their part.
They cannot limit themselves simply to “supervision” and appeals to the authorities. They must expand into other avenues of appeal: public hearings, welfare lawsuits, enhanced media coverage, and other voluntary activities.
But ultimate power does rest with the government.
China’s leaders need to make several concrete moves in order to move beyond rhetoric.
They must give real power to environmental officials to implement existing laws and close gaping legal loopholes.
This can only be done by introducing legal mechanisms to reward those who protect the environment, while making polluters pay, and by helping to unify the environmental watchdogs scattered across different sectors.
Above all, a system needs to be established to monitor officials’ performance in environmental as well as in economic terms.
China is dangerously near a crisis point.
The country’s enormous environmental debt will have to be paid, one way or another.
China must exercise the foresight needed to begin paying this debt now, when it is manageable, rather than allowing it to accumulate and, ultimately, threaten to bankrupt us all.
BEIJING – China’s “face” may be its Achilles’ Heel.
As it basks in its new status as an economic superpower – the dragon that is outpacing Asia’s tigers as well as the donkeys of the West – China is mistakenly downplaying its own serious structural weaknesses.
The communist leadership finds it hard to mention, let alone emphasize, the country’s problems.
Officials’ preoccupation with commanding respect and not losing face leads them to focus almost exclusively on China’s achievements.
This is a strategy that risks backfiring, because it misunderstands the dynamics of international politics.
Emphasizing China’s meteoric rise means less understanding in the rest of the world of the need to sustain rapid economic development in order to satisfy the expectations of its 1.3 billion inhabitants.
The government knows that it has a political tiger by the tail, but refuses to acknowledge it, either inside China or outside.
Trade tensions continue to mount.
The United States is deeply concerned, following the minimal results of its “strategic economic dialogue” with China in May, and Congress is threatening tough protectionist measures.
The European Union may not be far behind; much will depend on how China presents its case over the coming 18 months as the two sides negotiate a wide-ranging Partnership Cooperation Agreement, which will determine the quality of bilateral relations for the next decade.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just visited Beijing, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy likely to follow soon.
Both are surely aware that China’s surging exports last year helped it surpass the US as Europe’s largest foreign supplier.
What they won’t see, of course, are the desperately low living standards of China’s teeming millions, especially the rural poor.
Yet China is in no mood to plead poverty when dealing with the West.
Its aim is to gain as much prestige as possible from the Olympic games in 2008 and the six-month World Expo in Shanghai during the spring and summer of 2010.
It remains to be seen whether the two events will be capable of swinging world opinion in China’s favor and keeping it there.
Indeed, the government’s suspicion of the international media is liable to spark friction when thousands of journalists arrive and inevitably widen their coverage beyond athletics to politics and human rights.
For the time being, sentiment about China’s future remains relentlessly upbeat.
McKinsey consultants have even forecast that the upper middle-class will number 520 million by 2025 – the sort of projection that the communist mandarins welcome as a tribute to their strange hybrid of a market economy and rigid state control.
Yet it is almost certainly the sort of forecast of which they should beware.
The reality of life in today’s China looks very different from the vantage point of a province far from the heady atmosphere of Beijing or Shanghai.
For example, like much of the country, Gansu Province, at China’s geographical center, is grappling with structural and social problems that range from the daunting to the apparently insuperable.
Average annual output per capita is about $900, and incomes among the peasants who make up most of its rural population of 26 million are less than $250.
Gansu’s challenges range from modernizing its heavy industries to resisting desertification and the encroachment of the Gobi desert.
While it has been making slow but steady progress, its future is clouded by worsening water shortages; though it straddles the Yellow River, the water table is dwindling fast.
Back in Beijing, the chief preoccupation is to safeguard 11% GDP growth while assuaging Western governments.
By the end of this year, China’s exports will be 24% higher than in 2006, at $1.2 trillion, and its trade surplus will have grown by 43%.
But trade will probably not be the main worry for China’s international relations.
Trouble seems more likely to come from growing concern in the West over climate change.
Political leaders in EU capitals and the US may be well aware of China’s global economic importance, but the widespread public perception is that its factories are dirty and environmentally harmful.
Rows over product safety and intellectual piracy could all too easily fuel calls for tough new trade limits.
The answer is not for China to step up its public-relations effort.
Instead, it should be revealing its weaknesses and vulnerabilities to gain Western understanding.
That really would be a cultural revolution.
The Western media have a habit of going on feeding frenzies.
Ironically, when it comes to China, the latest frenzy concerns food itself.
The execution this week of the former head of China’s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), Zhen Xiaoyu, who accepted almost $1 million in bribes, shows that the frenzy has now seeped into China as well.
First came a spate of stories about pet food laced with melamine (a coal derivative), cough medicine and toothpaste adulterated with diethylene glycol (a sweet-tasting industrial chemical used in anti-freeze and brake fluid), toy trains decorated with lead-based paints, bacteria-infected antibiotics, exploding cell phone batteries, and defective car tires.
Now, attention has now turned to food.
The world press is filled with stories about honey laced with industrial sweeteners, canned goods contaminated by bacteria and excessive amounts of additives, rice wine braced with industrial alcohol, and farm-raised fish, eel, and shrimp fed large doses of antibiotics and then washed down with formaldehyde to lower bacterial counts.
In response, China’s government acted almost instantly.
The General Administration of Quality and Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine conducted a survey and reported that nearly one-fifth of all products made in China for domestic use did not measure up to safety and quality standards.
At the same time, regulators increased inspections, closed down some 180 food manufacturers and now post the names of violators on their Web site.
Moreover, not only was Zhen Xiaouyu executed, but Cao Wenzhuang, who was in charge of drug registration at the SFDA, was sentenced to death for accepting roughly $300,000 in bribes from drug manufacturers.
Both verdicts were doubtless calculated, as a famous Chinese proverb puts it, to “kill some chickens in order to scare the monkeys.”
But why does this surprise us?
After all, “capitalism with Chinese characteristics” has been a chaotic free-for-all for some time.
Roughly 75% of China’s food is now produced by small, private, and un-licensed operations that are difficult to regulate.
With little knowledge of China’s tectonic changes, foreigners have been investing, buying, trading, and extravagantly praising its amazing, but hell-bent, “economic boom.”
Fear of “China bashing” has made it difficult for so-called “friends of China” to discuss its darker side openly.
The Chinese people themselves, however, have been far from unaware that the purity of their food, medicine, water, and air is in doubt.
The xiadao xiaoxi (back alley news) has long been replete with rumors of things going awry.
One small-time operation ground up sheet-rock and put it in gel-caps to sell as medicine. A peasant village raided a hospital dumpster to reclaim discarded surgical equipment, wash it in a nearby canal, re-package it in sealed plastic saying “sterilized,” and sell it back to the hospital at cut-rate prices.
It has not helped, of course, that the Communist Party loathes a free press and a robust civil society, both of which are essential information feedback loops in ensuring any country’s well-being.
Nor has it helped that China’s regulatory agencies lag far behind the growth of its economy.
For example, the Beijing office of China’s State Environmental Protection Administration has less than 300 employees, whereas the United States Environmental Protection Administration has over 17,000.
China’s mad rush toward fuqiang (wealth and power) has given it little chance to develop all the compensatory institutions that any truly developed, not to say enlightened, society needs to achieve equilibrium and social health.
But in today’s globalized world, where national boundaries have morphed into synapses for myriad kinds of uncontrollable interactions, each country’s problems have become everyone’s problem.
So, before we in the West becomes too censorious of China’s quality control problems, we should remember our complicity in making China the world’s industrial park and global dumping ground for many toxic industries.
While we may lament the loss of manufacturing jobs through “outsourcing,” we certainly do not lament exporting massive amounts of pollution to China.
China may come to rue the wanton eagerness with which it has embraced industrialization.
Already, the Chinese are beginning to awaken from the infatuation with development that besieged them as they began to emerge from the commodity-starved Cultural Revolution.
In a world of scarcity, more always seemed better.
But now, just as the West began to understand decades ago that the natural environment has limits, China is showing the first signs of entering a post-industrial phase.
So, rather than simply shutting our doors to Chinese products, we might contemplate helping China by opening the doors of our regulatory agencies to Chinese regulators.
To do so would actually help ourselves.
For, even with “strategic competitors” like China, we now live in a global commons in which we share air, water, manufactured goods, and even food.
Eleven years after its initial connection to the World Wide Web (WWW), China’s access to the Internet is still guarded by firewalls, embedded in its proxy servers, which have proven to be more practical and impenetrable than the Berlin Wall.
Moreover, an increase in the demand for broadband connection has triggered the launch of an $800 million “Jin Dun (Golden Shield) Project,” an automatic digital system of public policing that will help prolong Communist rule by denying China’s people the right to information.
The principle underlying the Golden Shield is that “as virtue rises one foot, vice rises ten.”
Aided by systems developed by western intelligence agencies, China has forged a virtual sword that threatens to block the path to democracy.
Internet “gateways” mainly supervise and filter political information in China.
Their technical functions include blocking overseas Web sites, filtering content and key words on Web pages, monitoring email and Internet cafes, hijacking PC’s, sending out viruses, and inter-connecting with the monitoring systems of the Public Security Bureaus.
Rather than heralding a new era of freedom, the Internet is enabling Chinese authorities to perfect totalitarian control in a way that puts the rulers in George Orwell’s 1984 to shame.
Since April 15 of this year, the Golden Shield’s advanced science and technology has been monitoring every thought and action of those Chinese people who use the Internet.
But what Orwell failed to predict is that China’s government has accomplished this with the help of Western democracies.
Today, China is the only country in the world that has enshrined in law the concept of a “Web political criminal.”
Publishing articles on the Internet can amount to “committing an offense,” and “radical views” may result in imprisonment.
The real criminals, the officers of the companies – Nortel, Cisco, and Sun Microsystems – that built this sinister system of mind control, will never get closer to a prison than China’s five-star hotels.
Since the first Chinese Web criminal, Lin Haiyin, was imprisoned for instigating subversive actions in 2000 to the recent arrest of writer Shi Tao, more than 100 independent intellectuals have been imprisoned for expressing their views.
Internet monitoring is also behind the constant rise in the number of Falun Gong practitioners executed by the state – a total of 1,692 as of April 18.
Internet communication in modern China is filled with baits and traps: user-friendly Web page designs, easy-to-click icons and symbolized facial expressions, beautiful female stars in online ads and constantly updated international news induce users to participate and express their own ideas.
But once someone’s fingertips touch the keyboard, the “Kitchen Table Democracy” of the Web no longer exists – he or she may find themselves stepping into a trap, because the Internet Police monitor every word that is typed.
In a country where freedom of expression has been off limits for half a century, the Internet had at first proven to be a godsend: people poured their enthusiasm into it by building Web sites and personal homepages.
Now these people find themselves exposed to the Public Security Bureaus.
For example, the Democracy and Freedom Web site has been either temporarily shut down or blocked 43 times in three years.
Its robust reports on the death of Zhao Ziyang, the reform-minded leader of the 1980’s who was imprisoned for objecting to the Tiananmen Square crackdown of June 1989, ultimately forced it to succumb to the power of the “Golden Shield.”
Today, the average online lifespan of proxy servers in China is a mere 30 minutes, and 17,000 Internet cafes have been shut down.
The online filtering technology is capable of blocking or intercepting the emails of the 80 million or so “Net citizens” in China.
Because Internet chat rooms and personal emails have become essential to many Chinese, the upgrading of Internet supervision is also gaining momentum.
As a result, thinkers today are far more likely to get caught expressing “unsanctioned” ideas than they ever were in the 1980’s and early 1990’s, when underground publications served as the main channel of free expression.
Indeed, although the Internet’s coverage in China has been expanding steadily, the Communist Party’s ability to censor it has grown even faster, thanks to Western technology.
The Party has been dreaming of this kind of oversight ever since its revolutionary days.
Dictatorship is not only safe in China, but, at least for now, it is on the offensive.
But not forever.
Although “the Golden Shield Project” is the Communist Party’s largest single investment in the ideological field since it gained control of China in 1949, it is also likely to be the last big bet before the Party’s collapse.
Like the Berlin Wall, China’s Internet restrictions may be technically sound, even as they defend the indefensible and sustain the unsustainable.
The China Daily recently ran a front-page story recounting how Paul Wolfowitz used threats and vulgarities to pressure senior World Bank staff.
The newspaper noted that Wolfowitz sounded like a character out of the mafia television show The Sopranos .
At the same time, while the Wolfowitz scandal unfolded, China was playing host to the Africa Development Bank (ADB), which held its Board meeting in Shanghai.
This is a vivid metaphor for today’s world: while the World Bank is caught up in corruption and controversy, China skillfully raises its geopolitical profile in the developing world.
China’s rising power is, of course, based heavily on its remarkable economic success.
The ADB meeting took place in the Pudong District, Shanghai’s most remarkable development site.
From largely unused land a generation ago, Pudong has become a booming center of skyscrapers, luxury hotels, parks, industry, and vast stretches of apartment buildings.
Shanghai’s overall economy is currently growing at around 13% per year, thus doubling in size every five or six years.
Everywhere there are startups, innovations, and young entrepreneurs hungry for profits.
I had the chance to participate in high-level meetings between Chinese and African officials at the ADB meetings.
The advice that the African leaders received from their Chinese counterparts was sound, and much more practical than they typically get from the World Bank.
Chinese officials stressed the crucial role of public investments, especially in agriculture and infrastructure, to lay the basis for private-sector-led growth.
In a hungry and poor rural economy, as China was in the 1970’s and as most of Africa is today, a key starting point is to raise farm productivity.
Peasant farmers need the benefits of fertilizer, irrigation, and high-yield seeds, all of which were a core part of China’s economic takeoff.
Two other critical investments are also needed: roads and electricity, without which there cannot be a modern economy.
Farmers might be able to increase their output, but it won’t be able to reach the cities, and the cities won’t be able to provide the countryside with inputs.
The officials stressed how the government has taken pains to ensure that the power grid and transportation network reaches every village in China.
Of course, the African leaders were most appreciative of the next message: China is prepared to help Africa in substantial ways in agriculture, roads, power, health, and education.
And the African leaders already know that this is not an empty boast.
All over Africa, China is financing and constructing basic infrastructure.
During the meeting, the Chinese leaders emphasized their readiness to support agricultural research as well.
They described new high-yield rice varieties, which they are prepared to share with their African counterparts.
All of this illustrates what is wrong with the World Bank, even aside from Wolfowitz’s failed leadership.
Unlike the Chinese, the Bank has too often forgotten the most basic lessons of development, preferring to lecture the poor and force them to privatize basic infrastructure, rather than to help the poor to invest in infrastructure and other crucial sectors.
The Bank’s failures began in the early 1980’s, when, under the ideological sway of President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it tried to get Africa and other poor regions to cut back or close down government investments and services.
For 25 years, the Bank tried to get governments out of agriculture, leaving impoverished peasants to fend for themselves.
The result has been a disaster in Africa, with farm productivity stagnant for decades.
The Bank also pushed for privatization of national health systems, water utilities, and road and power networks, and grossly underfinanced these critical sectors.
This extreme free-market ideology, also called “structural adjustment,” went against the practical lessons of development successes in China and the rest of Asia.
Practical development strategy recognizes that public investments – in agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure – are necessary complements to private investments.
The World Bank has instead wrongly seen such vital public investments as an enemy of private-sector development.
Whenever the Bank’s extreme free-market ideology failed, it has blamed the poor for corruption, mismanagement, or lack of initiative.
This was Wolfowitz’s approach, too.
Instead of focusing the Bank’s attention on helping the poorest countries to improve their infrastructure, he launched a crusade against corruption.
Ironically, of course, his stance became untenable when his own misdeeds came to light.
The Bank can regain its relevance only if it becomes practical once again, by returning its focus to financing public investments in priority sectors, just as the Chinese leadership is prepared to do.
The good news is that African governments are getting the message on how to spur economic growth, and are also getting crucial help from China and other partners that are less wedded to extreme free-market ideology than the World Bank.
Many African governments at the Shanghai meeting declared their intention to act boldly, by investing in infrastructure, agricultural modernization, public health, and education.
The Wolfowitz debacle should be a wake-up call to the World Bank: it must no longer be controlled by ideology.
If that happens, the Bank can still do justice to the bold vision of a world of shared prosperity that prompted its creation after World War II.
China is now an active member of the world economic and political community.
Relative affluence and greater personal freedom exist for many, even as other Chinese citizens are racked by the travails of modernization.
Many anticipate that China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will speed these trends along and may even precipitate fundamental and legal political change.
Although forward momentum will be slower than many anticipate, the changes exacted by WTO membership will be profound because China's future will be dictated or determined more than ever before by factors beyond Beijing's control.
Moreover, WTO membership will not only prevent backsliding but will raise fundamental questions about national sovereignty and powerful debates about the amount of foreign engagement China is willing to tolerate.
The impact will go beyond economics to affect, deeply, social and political life.
Although some analysts produced doomsday scenarios about increasing unrest from rising unemployment and inequality, liberal intellectuals in China welcome membership in anticipation of a more rule-bound and democratic political order.
In reality, entry will push forward trends set in motion well before China joined the WTO.
The demise of the old economic order will be hastened while the emerging private enterprise and new sectors will become ever more privileged.
In the social realm, WTO entry will increase inequality and the restructuring of the labor force into extremes of wealth and poverty.
In this process, the concentration of foreign direct investment (FDI) along the coasts will also continue to exacerbate regional inequalities.
In 1998, Guangdong province alone received 26.5% of FDI while the entire West of China received 3%.
As a result, those living in Shanghai enjoy a real income twice that of the Northwest and 60% higher than the Southwest.
Already radically different levels of education, resource endowment and skilled labor mean that, with WTO entry, the already privileged coastal areas of China will continue to advance disproportionately over more backward inland areas.
Increased economic competition will also add to unemployment in the state-owned sector while new, private job creation will not match the rising need.
For example, the real unemployment rate in the Northeast is already over 10% and this region will feel the strongest impact from agricultural changes.
While much of China will gain from agricultural diversification, areas such as the Northeast that are overly dependent on grain production will suffer because under the WTO China will import much cheaper and better quality grain for both human consumption and animal fodder, causing rural incomes to decline even further.
Migration to a city will be the only choice for many dispossessed peasants.
It is no surprise, then, that rural and urban unrest is mounting.
China's new leadership must address this rising tide of disaffection when calculating the pace with which to move ahead with WTO compliance.
The CCP must decide how to accommodate the social forces that will benefit from further globalization while disentangling itself from its traditional power base, housed in the failing state-owned sector propped up by the old central planning apparatus.
To deal with the social cleavages that will increase as a result of WTO accession, China will have to develop more participatory and open mechanisms by allowing for a competitive political market place to develop to parallel the economic one.
Doubtless, such changes will be difficult for the CCP to accept.
No less necessary will be further development of a legal and regulatory framework as a means to improve the potential for both domestic and international investment.
Here the major challenge will be for the CCP to accept that WTO membership presumes that disputes will be resolved by an independent, rules-based, supra-national body rather than by party-fiat or through the mediation of local political connections.
Within China, pressure will mount for a more independent judiciary to adjudicate economic issues and create greater transparency in international transactions.
Such changes run counter to current practice and will not be easy for party members to swallow.
The developed economies of the world can facilitate this process.
Sluggish progress may be unacceptable, but outsiders must recognize that the CCP must balance the imperatives of progress against mushrooming social unrest.
China has agreed to implement its WTO commitments in a stunningly short period of time that can only have been agreed to because of extreme American pressure.
But China is too big and too political to be pushed so fast that it is not permitted sufficient time to adapt properly.
Cooler heads must prevail around the world so that China is not taken to WTO dispute mechanisms for each and every insignificant infraction.
In short, there needs to be political maturity exercised by everyone as China integrates with the world economy.
Importantly, those countries who expect China to yield to WTO protocols will have to behave responsibly when demanding it abide by international decisions beyond its own jurisdiction, not all of which will be to its liking.
To date, this has not been a strong suit, particularly for America.
But if disdain is shown for the WTO process, there will be little incentive for China to comply during the difficult months ahead.
China’s rulers rarely wash their dirty linen in public.
So the arrest of Politburo member and Shanghai Communist Party boss Chen Liangyu on corruption charges has sent shock waves across the country.
Some speculate that the arrest is really part of a power struggle, with President Hu Jingtao demonstrating his authority against a local power broker who had thwarted national policy.
Whatever the truth behind Chen’s fall, and despite the widening corruption probe of other senior government officials, data and evidence recently released by the government and multilateral institutions suggest that the authorities are fighting a rearguard battle against a rising tide of graft.
Consider the grim statistics recently released by the Supreme People’s Procuratorate (SPP).
More than 42,000 government officials on average were investigated for corruption every year from 2002 to 2005, with more than 30,000 per year facing criminal charges.
These startling figures do not include economic crimes outside the public sector.
For example, in 2005 alone, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) unearthed irregularities involving misused funds of RMB767.1 billion ($93.7 billion).
The CBRC uncovered 1,272 criminal cases and disciplined 6,826 bank employees (including 325 senior managers).
According to Ye Feng, a SPP Director-General, “[a]lmost every type of financial institution has seen the emergence of criminal cases involving the solicitation of bribes in return for loans.”
Despite the government’s intermittent anti-corruption campaigns, progress has been slow.
On the contrary, as Ye has candidly acknowledged, the number of corruption cases “has continued to rise.”
Indeed, international measures of graft show that the authorities may be reaching a stalemate or even retreating in the fight.
Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, the most widely-used benchmark to gauge businessmen’s and experts’ beliefs about the extent of corruption in various countries, ranked China 78th out of 158 countries in 2005 – not much improvement from 2000.
Indeed, among the World Bank’s six “Governance Indicators,” China’s scores on the “Control of Corruption” index have actually slipped in recent years, from -0.20 in 1998 to -0.40 in 2002 and -0.69 in 2005.
In 2005, the World Bank ranked China 142nd out of 204 countries on the “Control of Corruption” index.
While the economic toll of graft cannot be precisely quantified, indirect evidence suggests that the costs are significant.
Multinational executives frequently cite China as their favorite investment destination, but many of them also complain about rampant graft.
According to the World Bank’s “Investment Climate Surveys”, 27% of nearly 4,000 firms doing business in China in 2002-03 described corruption as a “major constraint” on their commercial operations, while 55% reported that they had paid bribes to government bureaucrats and/or local business partners to get things done.
Likewise, Hu Angang, an economics professor at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, has estimated that corruption in 1999-2001 alone caused economic losses worth RMB1,293 billion ($156 billion), or 13.2% of GDP.
Not surprisingly, the financial services sector suffered the most from corruption, losing RMB547 billion (6.25% of GDP).
Fraudulent public expenditure cost 2.4% of GDP, siphoning off privatization proceeds amounted to almost 2.1% of GDP, and smuggling caused losses of more than 1.1% of GDP.
The Chinese government has neither censored nor refuted Hu’s dreadful findings.
The biggest obstacle to fighting graft is the weakness of the judiciary, especially at sub-national levels.
Since most government corruption occurs at the county, township and village levels, it usually involves abuses of power by local officials.
However, since these petty bureaucrats’ power is almost absolute, they also control the channels for addressing grievances.
Indeed, among the World Bank’s six “Governance Indicators,” China’s score on the “Rule of Law” index has also slid in recent years, from -0.28 in 1998 to -0.47 in 2005, when China ranked 124th out of 208 countries in this category.
With little recourse to legal means, an increasing number of frustrated victims of graft resort to extra-legal measures such as strikes, demonstrations, and sit-ins in order to gain media and public attention.
Some even carry their fights to the provincial and central authorities, stoking a sharp rise in the incidents of “public order disturbances” nation-wide.
Whereas the Ministry of Public Security reported only 8,700 such disturbances in 1993, by 2005 the number had jumped ten-fold, to 87,000.
Needless to say, government mishandling of such disturbances, or a decision to repress them with force, would only fuel further social discontent.
In fact, the government’s success in clamping down on corruption, especially at sub-national levels, will be a litmus test of its legitimacy.
To fail would risk igniting a severe political backlash, including a spontaneous escalation of anti-regime activities.
BEIJING – Not long after the United States Federal Reserve Board announced its second round of “quantitative easing” (known as QE2), the People’s Bank of China (PBC), China’s central bank, announced two increases of 0.5 percentage points in the required reserve ratio (RRR) of bank deposits.
The RRR now stands at 18.5%, a historic high, even in global terms.
While the Fed is planning to pump more money into the US economy, the PBC is trying to reduce the amount of money in circulation in China.
Money used by commercial banks to satisfy the RRR, which is held in accounts at the PBC, can no longer be extended as loans.
As a result, more money than ever is now frozen or inactive in China.
It is understandable that the Fed wants to boost demand as long as the US economy remains depressed.
But why has the PBC tightened monetary policy so much?
The Chinese economy is not over-heating.
Growth is still high, at about 10% per year, but has started to moderate.
And, while inflation is a concern – having risen to 4.4% year on year in October, from 3.6% in September – this cannot explain why the PBC raised the RRR three times earlier this year, when inflation was lower.
Instead, the PBC’s policy is preemptive: sterilize over-liquidity and get the money supply under control in order to prevent inflation or over-heating.
At the beginning of the year, the RRR increases could be regarded as part of efforts to correct the over-supply of money that arose from the anti-crisis stimulus package.
But the most recent RRR increases serve mainly to sterilize the “passive money supply” caused by the increase in foreign-exchange reserves.
Indeed, in September alone, China’s foreign-currency reserves increased by almost $100 billion compared to August.
With the global economy recovering, China’s trade surplus began to grow.
Moreover, capital inflows increased significantly, owing to real investment opportunities in the high-growth economy and the expectation of renminbi revaluation.
But rapid growth in foreign-exchange reserves means an increase in the domestic money supply, because the PBC issues RMB6.64 (down 3% since June) for every dollar it receives.
That means that money supply increase by nearly RMB700 billion in September.
The two 50-basis-point RRR increases just locked up the same amount of liquidity.
A country with current-account and capital-account surpluses and increasing foreign-exchange reserves normally sees an excessive money supply and high inflation.
But, while excessive money supply is a reality for China – the PBC now holds more than $2.6 trillion in foreign reserves – inflation has been quite moderate so far, thanks to the sterilization policy.
The RRR is only one example of a textbook sterilization instrument.
Another is to sell off government bonds held by the central bank in order to take money out of circulation – again, just the opposite of what the Fed is now doing.
Because China’s government does not owe much debt to the public, the PBC sold out its holdings of government bonds in 2005.
So it had to create something else to sell.
It created so-called “Central Bank Bills,” which commercial banks are supposed to buy voluntarily.
When they do, the money they pay is also locked up in the PBC’s accounts.
To date, up to 5-6% of total liquidity has been returned to the central bank in this way.
Furthermore, the PBC uses unconventional instruments from time to time, such as “credit ceilings” or “credit quotas” imposed on commercial banks.
This may result in “extra reserves,” which commercial banks cannot use to extend their credit lines.
Credit quotas imposed early this year have left Chinese commercial banks with 2-3% of extra reserves.
Adding up the impact of the PBC’s sterilization efforts, roughly one-quarter of China’s total monetary base is illiquid.
Thus, although China’s total money supply seems excessive, with the M2-to-GDP ratio now at about 190%, the real monetary base is actually much smaller than it appears.
As a result, China’s inflation, as well as asset prices, remain under control.
For how long will this sterilization continue, and how far will it go?
At what point will higher RRR levels cause Chinese commercial banks to begin running losses?
There may be room for further sterilization.
First, unlike in some other countries, Chinese commercial banks are paid reasonable interest rates on required reserves, except for the “extra reserves” that they hold.
So they do not lose much, if anything, from the PBC’s sterilization policies.
Second, China’s central bank still controls interest rates by enforcing a roughly three-percentage-point spread between deposit rates and lending rates.
As a result, Chinese commercial banks can operate longer with a higher RRR than their counterparts elsewhere.
One key issue facing China is how to reduce the current- and capital-account surpluses in order to reduce foreign-exchange holdings.
Yes, further revaluation of the exchange rate is needed, but this can play only a secondary role.
The most important task for China is to reduce the saving rate, which equaled 52% of GDP in 2009.
A number of fiscal, social-security, and tax reforms should be a priority for this purpose.
But it seems that both revaluation and reform will take time. Meanwhile, the causes of global imbalance on the US side also seem unlikely to disappear any time soon.
And now, with the Fed’s QE2 on the table, conditions may worsen before they improve.
The PBC may have to continue its sterilization for some time in the foreseeable future.
China’s success since it began its transition to a market economy has been based on adaptable strategies and policies: as each set of problems are solved, new problems arise, for which new policies and strategies must be devised.
This process includes social innovation .
China recognized that it could not simply transfer economic institutions that had worked in other countries; at the least, what succeeded elsewhere had to be adapted to the unique problems confronting China.
Today, China is discussing a “new economic model.”
Of course, the old economic model has been a resounding success, producing almost 10% annual growth for 30 years and lifting hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty.
The changes are apparent not only in the statistics, but even more so in the faces of the people that one sees around the country.
I recently visited a remote Dong village in the mountains of Quizho, one of China’s poorest provinces, miles away from the nearest paved road; yet it had electricity, and with electricity had come not just television, but the internet.
While some rising incomes came from remittances from family members who had migrated to coastal cities, the farmers, too, were better off, with new crops and better seeds: the government was selling, on credit, high-grade seeds with a guaranteed rate of germination.
China knows that it must change if it is to have sustainable growth.
At every level, there is a consciousness of environmental limits and the realization that the resource-intensive consumption patterns now accepted in the United States would be a disaster for China – and for the world.
As an increasing share of China’s population moves to cities, those cities will have to be made livable, which will require careful planning, including public transportation systems and parks.
Equally interesting, China is attempting to move away from the export-led growth strategy that it and other East Asian countries have pursued.
That strategy supported technology transfer, helping to close the knowledge gap and rapidly improving the quality of manufactured goods.
Export-led growth meant that China could produce without worrying about developing the domestic market.
But a global backlash has already developed.
Even countries seemingly committed to competitive markets don’t like being beaten at their own game, and often trump up charges of “unfair competition.”
More importantly, even if markets are not fully saturated in many areas, it will be hard to maintain double-digit growth rates for exports.
So something has to change.
China has been engaged in what might be called “vendor finance,” providing the money that helps finance the huge US fiscal and trade deficits, allowing Americans to buy more goods than they sell.
But this is a peculiar arrangement: a relatively poor country is helping to finance America’s War on Iraq, as well as a massive tax cut for the richest people in the world’s richest country, while huge needs at home imply ample room for expansion of both consumption and investment.
In fact, to meet the challenge of restructuring China’s economy away from exports and resource-intensive goods, China must stimulate consumption.
While the rest of the world struggles to raise savings, China, with a savings rate in excess of 40%, struggles to get its people to consume more.
Providing better social services (public health care, education, and nation-wide retirement programs) would reduce the need for “precautionary” savings.
More access to finance for small and medium sized businesses would help, too.
And “green taxes” – such as on carbon emissions – would shift consumption patterns while discouraging energy-intensive exports.
As China moves away from export-led growth, it will have to look for new sources of dynamism in its growing entrepreneurial ranks, which requires a commitment to creating an independent innovation system.
China has long invested heavily in higher education and technology; now it is striving to create world-class institutions.
But if China wants a dynamic innovation system, it should resist pressure by Western governments to adopt the kind of unbalanced intellectual property laws that are being demanded.
Instead, it should pursue a “balanced” intellectual property regime: because knowledge itself is the most important input in the production of knowledge, a badly designed intellectual property regime can stifle innovation – as has been the case in America in some areas.
Western technological innovation has focused too little on reducing the adverse environmental impact of growth, and too much on saving labor – something that China has in abundance.
So it makes sense for China to focus its scientific prowess on new technologies that use fewer resources.
But it is important to have an innovation system (including an intellectual property regime) that ensures that advances in knowledge are widely used.
That may require innovative approaches, quite different from intellectual property regimes based on privatization and monopolization of knowledge, with the high prices and restricted benefits that follow.
Too many people think of economics as a zero-sum game, and that China’s success is coming at the expense of the rest of the world.
Yes, China’s rapid growth poses challenges to the West.
Competition will force some to work harder, to become more efficient, or to accept lower profits.
But economics is really a positive-sum game.
An increasingly prosperous China has not only expanded imports from other countries, but is also providing goods that have kept prices lower in the West, despite sharply higher oil prices in recent years.
This downward pressure on prices has allowed Western central banks to follow expansionary monetary policies, underpinning higher employment and growth.
We should all hope that China’s new economic model succeeds.
If it does, all of us will have much to gain.
The last time China’s President Jiang Zemin attended the Fortune Global Forum in Hong Kong, Time-Warner CEO Gerald Levin gave him an award named after Abraham Lincoln.
President Jiang returned recently to that global gathering of business leaders but, thankfully, a repeat of that appeasement did not occur.
Even Western bosses keen on China, it appears, are finding it hard nowadays to praise Jiang, as he crushes the Falun Gong spiritual movement by imprisoning or confining its members to psychiatric hospitals.
Forced removal into mental hospitals of many Falun Gong members is central to this campaign.
Overseas Falun Gong support groups have documented well over a hundred such cases.
Estimates of the number being “treated” in this way run to 600.
Three of those sent to mental asylums are reported to have died as a result of their ill treatment.
Little known to the outside world is China’s gulag archipelago of Ankang (“Peace and Health”) institutions.
The twenty-or-more institutions of this type are run by the Ministry of Public Security and are subordinate provincial departments.
Political dissidents and others in similar categories brought before State forensic psychiatrists are often treated as the most “serious and dangerous” of all supposed mentally ill offenders, and face compulsory committal in these secretive institutions.
Chinese forensic psychiatry has gone through several phases.
In the 1950s, Soviet influences (characterized by heretical clinical theories whereby particular forms of political and religious dissent were attributed to specific varieties of “dangerous” mental illness) dominated.
During the Cultural Revolution (1966�76), when human psychology was officially repudiated and “correct” political ideology was equated with mental health, some 50% to 70% of psychiatric appraisals of criminal detainees in areas including Shanghai were categorized as “political in nature.”
The 1980s saw a return to the more low�level psychiatric abuses of the pre�Cultural Revolution era.
At first, the 1990s brought a decrease in politically directed psychiatry.
In the wake of the Tiananmen massacre, however, individual dissidents and other political nonconformists were again committed to special psychiatric hospitals on an involuntary and indefinite basis.
One example is Xue Jifeng, a labor�rights activist detained by police in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, in December 1999 for attempting to meet with other labor activists.
He was committed involuntarily to the Xinxiang Municipal Mental Hospital, where he remained until July 2000.
Mr. Xue was reportedly force�fed psychiatric drugs and held in a room with true mental patients who kept him awake at night and harassed him by day.
Another labor organizer, Cao Maobing, was committed more recently by police to a mental hospital in Jiangsu province.
He was arrested after complaining to foreign reporters, and has since been administered medicine and forced to undergo electric shock therapy.
A coterie of experts, says the hospital’s director, found that Mr. Cao suffers from “paranoid psychosis.”
Why resort to such elaborate and costly measures against political/religious opponents when simpler methods of neutralizing them - such as execution or imprisonment - are available to dictators?
One reason is that in post�Mao China, as in the Soviet Union after Stalin's death, physical liquidation of political enemies was ended by reformist leaders dedicated to curtailing past “excesses.”
But because arrest no longer meant execution but long imprisonment, dissidents acquired a reasonable chance to emerge from prison or labor camps.
As a result, networks of dissidents arose in both the USSR and China after the deaths of Stalin and Mao.
The successors to those dictators, however, found this turn of events to be an unwanted complication in their political “thaws”; more sophisticated mechanisms to induce fear among their peoples were needed, and there are few deterrents to dissident activity more potent than the threat of removal to an institution for the criminally insane.
The outside world is not helpless in fighting against China’s abuse of psychiatry.
In 1983, a protracted campaign by Western psychiatric professional bodies and international human rights organizations led the Soviet All�Union Society of Psychiatrists and Neuropathologists to withdraw from the World Psychiatric Association so as to avoid expulsion.
It was not readmitted until 1989, after years of perestroika and the opening of direct access to Western psychiatric delegations by Soviet forensic�psychiatric institutions.
As a first step in this struggle, the World Psychiatric Association and national professional bodies should demand direct access to the Ankang network and other places of psychiatric incarceration.
Advocacy by local and international psychiatric bodies may also encourage Western governments and the European Union to place the issue of political�psychiatric abuse on the formal agenda of the regular sessions devoted to human rights that are now a staple of Sino�Western relations.
NEW DELHI – As senior leaders are purged and retired provincial officials publicly call for Politburo members to be removed, it has become clear that China is at a crossroads.
China’s future no longer looks to be determined by its hugely successful economy, which has turned the country into a world power in a single generation.
Instead, the country’s murky and increasingly fractured politics are now driving its fate.
One need look no further than the ongoing power struggle in the run-up to this autumn’s planned leadership changes, or official figures showing that rural protests have been increasing at the same rate as China’s GDP.
The sudden downfall of Bo Xilai – and the call from Yunnan Province for the removal of the two Politburo members closest to him – is just one example of the no-holds-barred infighting now taking place in Zhongnanhai, the closed leadership compound in Beijing.
Indeed, the internecine squabbles are said to be so vicious that there have been rumors, denied by the regime, that the Communist Party’s congress at which a new president and prime minister are to be anointed this autumn, might be postponed.
The Party’s abrupt vilification of Bo after lauding him for his leadership in Chongqing has fueled public cynicism over his orchestrated downfall and laid bare the leadership’s thin ideological core.
If China is to preserve its gains in global stature, it must avoid a political hard landing.
For the time being, at least five different scenarios are conceivable.
Re-equilibration: The Party protects its legitimacy, keeps the military subordinate, and manages to put a lid on popular dissent.
In other words, the status quo prevails for the foreseeable future.
This is the least likely scenario, owing to deepening internal Party disagreements and rising popular discontent.
Implosion: This likelihood of&nbsp;political disintegration, economic collapse, and social disorder may be no higher than that of re-equilibration.
The government’s fixation on weiwen, or stability maintenance, has resulted in China becoming the world’s only important country whose official internal-security budget is larger than its official national-defense budget.
This underscores the extent to which authorities have to carry out internal repression to perpetuate one-party rule and maintain control over the restive ethnic-minority homelands that make up more than 60% of China’s landmass.
But it may also explain why one self-immolation in Tunisia helped to kindle the Arab Spring, whereas some three dozen self-immolations by Tibetan monks and nuns have failed to ignite a similar popular movement against the Chinese state.
The Soviet Union imploded because the party was the state, and vice versa.
China, by contrast, has established strong institutional capacity, a multi-tiered federal structure, a tradition of civilian leadership turnover every ten years, and a well-oiled, sophisticated security apparatus that has kept pace with technological advances.
Thus, China’s government can pursue a policy of wai song nei jin – relaxed on the outside, vigilant internally.
Guided reform: A process of gradual political change begins, in keeping with outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao’s warning that without “urgent” reforms, China risks turmoil and disruption of economic growth.
Can China emulate the recent example of neighboring Myanmar (Burma), which has initiated significant, if still tenuous, political reforms?
As the political heirs of the country’s Communist revolutionaries, the third-generation leaders that are taking over the reins of power in China may possess a strong pedigree, but they are also scarred and limited by it.
These so-called princelings are trapped in the same political culture that led to the death of millions of Chinese and the continuing repression of opponents (real or imagined).
They do not look like political reformers in the slightest.
Great leap backward: A new “Cultural Revolution” erupts, as the clique in power ruthlessly seeks to suppress dissent within and outside the establishment.
As the Dalai Lama recently warned, there are still plenty of “worshippers of the gun” in power in China.
Indeed, such is China’s political system that only the strongest advance.
One fallen princeling, Bo, has been accused of cruelty and corruption – traits that are endemic in China’s cloistered but fragmented oligarchy, which values family lineage and relies on networks of allies.
Praetorian takeover: The People’s Liberation Army rules from behind a civilian mask, increasingly calling the shots with government officials, who are beholden to it.
While the civilian leadership has become diffuse (every Chinese leader since Mao Zedong has been weaker than his predecessor), the military has enjoyed greater autonomy and soaring budgets since 1990.
Indeed, the Party, having ceased to be a rigid monolith obedient to a single leader, has become dependent on the military for its political legitimacy and to ensure domestic order.
The PLA’s growing political clout has been manifest in the sharpening power struggle within the Party.
In recent weeks, an unusual number of senior military officers have published articles in official newspapers calling for Party discipline and unity, and alluding to the military’s role in containing the infighting.
Another development is the increasing tendency of military generals to speak out of turn on strategic issues and undercut diplomatic strategy.
The simple truth is that the foreign ministry is the Chinese government’s weakest branch, often overruled or simply ignored by the security establishment, which is ever ready to upstage even the Party.&nbsp;
China’s internal politics has a bearing on its external policy.
The weaker the civilian leadership has become, the more China has been inclined to discard Deng Xiaoping’s dictum tao guang yang hui (hide brightness, nourish obscurity).
China has lately taken more to the spotlight than to the shadows.
Under any plausible scenario, a restrained and stable Chinese foreign policy may become more difficult.
CAMBRIDGE – China is likely to be the first of the major economies to recover from the current global downturn.
Its pace of expansion may not reach the double-digit rates of recent years, but China in 2010 will probably grow more rapidly than any country in Europe or in the western hemisphere.
But, even as China recovers from its current slowdown, it is not likely to provide a similar boost to all of its trading partners.
That lack of spillover will reflect the recovery’s focus on expansion of domestic demand.
There is no doubt that China currently is suffering from the global collapse in demand for a wide range of manufactured products.
The sharp drop in retail sales in the United States and Europe means fewer orders for the goods produced in Chinese factories.
And, while the Chinese yuan has remained more or less unchanged relative to the US dollar in the past year, the dollar’s sharp appreciation relative to the euro and other currencies caused the overall trade-weighted value of the yuan to rise.
This further depressed Chinese exports.
The resulting layoffs of Chinese factory workers has caused second-round declines in local demand for Chinese goods and services, as Chinese households cut back on their spending.
Small firms that exported 100% of their production have been forced to close.
Millions of low-skilled workers who left farms in China’s interior to work in coastal manufacturing centers are now being forced to return to their villages.
The families benefiting from their remittances will now be forced to cut their consumption as well.
The Chinese authorities are determined to reverse the resulting decline in growth in order to reemploy those who have lost their jobs and to create employment for the millions of young people who join the labor force each year.
Failure to do so would not only create hardship for the millions of unemployed, but would also threaten political stability, which depends on the expectation of continuing economic prosperity.
The government’s initial policies aimed at raising aggregate demand focused on major infrastructure spending, including roads and mass transit.
But the more significant strategy is to alter government policies in ways that will lead to higher spending by Chinese consumers, and that raise the level of those government outlays, like health care, which directly benefit Chinese households.
Spending by China’s consumers has lagged behind the Chinese economy’s overall rate of growth for many years.
This reflects the declining share of wages in total GDP and the rising share of savings relative to household incomes.
To raise consumer spending, the Chinese government must reverse both of these trends.
Although private enterprises are the fastest growing part of the Chinese economy, enterprises that are partially or fully owned by the state continue to be major employers.
The government can directly affect wage levels in these firms, thereby altering the general wage level in the economy.
The high saving rate of Chinese households reflects both the normal high rate of saving among younger generations and the fact that older generations had very little income – and therefore did very little saving – when they were young.
The aggregate saving rate of the household sector reflects the difference between the saving of the savers and the dissaving of the dissavers.
Since the saving of younger savers is now high and the dissaving of the older dissavers is low, the net saving rate is high.
Young people have many reasons to save.
The public pension system is unreliable, there is little health insurance available to pay for the high cost of Western-style care, parents must pay tuition for their children’s schooling, there is little credit available for purchases of consumer durable, and buying an apartment requires a large down-payment.
I believe that the government will act on all of these reasons for high saving, making credit more widely available, introducing a health insurance system, and relaxing some of the down-payment requirements.
Premier Wen Jiabao made clear in his recent remarks to the People’s Congress that he will do what it takes to stimulate demand in order to ensure strong growth in China.
I have little doubt about his willingness and ability to do so.
As the 82 nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party approached last July, the Party's new General Secretary, Hu Jintao, seemed on the verge of announcing a whole new range of reforms.
In a ceremony celebrating the promulgation of the current 1982 constitution, Hu reportedly expressed interest in strengthening constitutional protections against official intrusions in people's lives and in promoting extensive legal reform.
Indeed, he was even rumored to be considering more inner-Party democratization, greater press freedom, strengthening non-Communist political parties, and permitting exiled dissidents to return home.
Such optimistic views were re-enforced when Chinese intellectuals--even some official scholars--began writing and speaking out in favor of re-evaluating controversial Party verdicts on historical incidents (such as the Tiananmen Square massacre).
Similarly, there was an increase in public advocacy on behalf of rural workers (who have been migrating by the tens of millions into China's cities), as well as calls for significant constitutional changes.
For example, legal scholar Cao Siyuan began writing on, lobbying for, and organizing conferences about constitutional reform.
The fact that Cao was detained after the 1989 Beijing Massacre, expelled from the Party, spent time abroad lecturing, and now runs a research consulting firm, seemed no impediment.
Mr Cao was careful to stay within the bounds of moderate reformism, yet he openly called for reform within five areas of governance: the constitution, separation of powers, elections, political parties, and the culture of politics.
For their part, Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao were even reported to have authorized a top-level body, "The Leading Group On Revising the Constitution," to draft "sweeping changes" that would be considered in March 2004 when the next plenary session of the National People's Congress met.
The proposed changes were reported to include an amendment that would guarantee the same rights to property for private entrepreneurs as for state-owned enterprises, the constitutional right of Party members to choose their leaders, and even some steps toward a multi-party political system.
The Party's evident tolerance toward these ideas was assumed to emanate from Hu Jintao himself.
When Hu also cancelled the traditional closed-door summer caucus of old Party elders that takes place each year at the beach resort of Beidaihe, hopes were raised that political reform might actually burst forth.
However, when none of these issues were raised in Hu's July 1 st speech to the nation, reform-minded Chinese were palpably discouraged.
To the disappointment of many, Hu ended up giving a lackluster oration that, instead of extolling political reform, re-emphasized the dreary notion of the Three Represents--the banal theory advanced by former Party chief Jiang Zemin, which allowed businessmen to be included in the Party.
Then reform-minded intellectuals like Cao Siyuan began to be trailed by Public Security Bureau goons, and members attending a conferences on legal reform organized by Cao were admonished by the Propaganda Department (China's censors) to stop discussing the "three unmentionables," (political reform, constitutional revision, and reversing the verdicts on historical incidents).
It was clear that the reform bandwagon had hit a wall.
Indeed, the Party soon issued a document to think tanks, media outlets and universities banning all public debate on these issues.
What happened?
As so often in the past, this latest reform effort hit the limits of permissible Party tolerance almost before it got going.
It is an old story in China: calls for reform by liberalizers end up antagonizing conservative Party members--in this case, the political faction of Jiang Zemin, who, although not on the Politburo standing committee, still heads the powerful central Military Commission and wields substantial influence.
The reformers were silenced in the name of maintaining stability.
Since the early 1980's China has experienced many iterations of this dynamic.
While it is true that some modest residue of progress often remains after these episodes end, China's current political environment is far more censorious and intolerant now than it was in the mid-1980's.
Indeed, this most recent example of reformus interruptus once again raises the all-important question of whether China can actually undergo a "peaceful evolution," at least so long as the Chinese Communist Party remains in control.
What this pattern suggests is that the Party can rarely choke down more than the smallest dose of political reform, much less outright criticism before reacting in an almost autonomic fashion against it.
While a process of "peaceful evolution" offers the best prospect for change in this mutating "people's republic," the Party's demonstrated inability to countenance even the most modest quotients of political challenge--even with a new generation of leaders in power--does not inspire confidence in the prospect for piecemeal reform.
The failure of this latest mini-reform movement suggests that when it comes to politics, fazhi , or the rule of law, has still made relatively little progress in eclipsing renzhi , the rule of men.
China may be something of a miracle of economic reform, but until changes come in its Leninist governmental system, borrowed from the USSR during the Stalinist era, a truly new New China will never arise.
While one hopes that China will find some way to continue transforming itself peacefully, the Communist Party's continuing intolerance of free expression, and its refusal to allow its people even to discuss in public how their government might be reformed, does not bode well for the future.
China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, setting the stage for the continuation of probably the most remarkable economic transformation in history, while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world’s population.
Never before has the world seen such sustained growth; never before has there been so much poverty reduction.
Part of the key to China’s long-run success has been its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision.
While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, has been directed at a quixotic quest for higher GDP, China has once again made clear that it seeks sustainable and more equitable increases in real living standards.
China realizes that it has entered a phase of economic growth that is imposing enormous – and unsustainable – demands on the environment.
Unless there is a change in course, living standards will eventually be compromised.
That is why the new five-year plan places great emphasis on the environment.
Even many of the more backward parts of China have been growing at a pace that would be a marvel, were it not for the fact that other parts of the country are growing even more rapidly.
While this has reduced poverty, inequality has been increasing, with growing disparities between cities and rural areas, and between coastal regions and the interior.
This year’s World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, not just poverty, should be a concern, and China’s 11th five-year plan attacks the problem head-on.
The government has for several years talked about a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programs for achieving this.
China recognizes, too, that what separates less developed from more developed countries is not only a gap in resources, but also a gap in knowledge.
So it has laid out bold plans not only to reduce that gap, but to create a basis for independent innovation.
China’s role in the world and the world’s economy has changed, and the plan reflects this, too.
Its future growth will have to be based more on domestic demand than on exports, which will require increases in consumption.
Indeed, China has a rare problem: excessive savings.
People save partly because of weaknesses in government social-insurance programs; strengthening social security (pensions) and public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities, increase citizens’ sense of well-being, and promote current consumption.
If successful – and, so far, China has almost always surpassed even its own high expectations – these adjustments may impose enormous strains on a global economic system that is already unbalanced by America’s huge fiscal and trade imbalances.
If China saves less – and if, as officials have announced, it pursues a more diversified policy of investing its reserves – who will finance America’s more than $2 billion a day trade deficit?
This is a topic for another day, but that day may not be far off.
With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will be implementation.
China is a large country, and it could not have succeeded as it has without widespread decentralization.
But decentralization raises problems of its own.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America says that it cannot afford to do anything about it, China’s senior officials have acted more responsibly.
Within a month of the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline, and wood products were imposed: China was using market based mechanisms to address its and the world’s environmental problems.
But the pressures on local government officials to deliver economic growth and jobs will be enormous.
They will be sorely tempted to argue that if America cannot afford to produce in a way that preserves our planet, how can we?
To translate its vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies, such as the environmental taxes already imposed.
As China has moved toward a market economy, it has developed some of the problems that have plagued the developed countries: special interests that clothe self-serving arguments behind a thin veil of market ideology.
Some will argue for trickle-down economics: don’t worry about the poor, eventually everybody will benefit from growth.
And some will oppose competition policy and strong corporate governance laws: let Darwinian survival work its wonders.
Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: higher gasoline taxes, for example, will kill our nascent auto industry.
Such allegedly pro-growth policies would not only fail to deliver growth; they would threaten the entire vision of China’s future.
There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.
George W. Bush has shown the dangers of excessive secrecy and confining decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants.
Most people outside China do not fully appreciate the extent to which its leaders, by contrast, have engaged in extensive deliberations and broad consultations (even with foreigners) as they strive to solve the enormous problems they face.
Market economies are not self-regulating.
They cannot simply be left on autopilot, especially if one wants to ensure that their benefits are shared widely.
But managing a market economy is no easy task.
It is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes.
China’s 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap for that response.
The world watches in awe, and hope, as the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be transformed.
China’s president, Hu Jintao, is currently touring Africa, seeking to secure dependable sources of natural resources, but also to promote China’s “peaceful rise.”
Such tours are designed to give notice that China is emerging on the world stage, as well as to make it look respectable as a major world power.
But China’s quest for international respect is not well served by its embrace of rogue nations like Sudan, Venezuela, and Burma, much less by its secretive military build-up and its recent adventure in outer space.
Indeed, when the Chinese military secretly and recklessly fired a land-based missile into outer space in mid-January and shattered one of China’s aging satellites, the government caused outrage from London to Tokyo to Washington.
After several days of silence in the face of incontrovertible evidence of the launch, China’s leaders reluctantly admitted what China had done, but claimed that the “test was not directed at any country and does not constitute a threat to any country.”
Such denials are becoming unconvincing.
In fact, this dangerous and irresponsible action is yet another key sign that China’s rise as a global power lacks any guarantee that it will be a peaceful nation once it grows strong.
It flatly contradicts the repeated assurances of China’s leaders that China’s rise will bring only “harmony” and peace to the international community.
Lurking behind China’s ambition in space is the spirit of the Cold War, which continues to permeate the inner circles of the military high command, whose adversary is unmistakably the United States.
With the collapse of the Soviet communist regime, the US continues to enjoy a dominant role in space exploration for peaceful and scientific development.
But since the 1980’s, the US has been ambivalent about the ultimate military and civilian utility of its space efforts.
This ambivalence has now been greatly reduced because of China’s recent action, which could precipitate a race to militarize and weaponize outer space.
Should this happen, China would share a large part of the blame.
China’s adventurism and its blithe assumption that it can deal with any international dictator it wishes and disturb the delicate military balance in outer space is emblematic of something sinister and dangerous.
Partly because of the patronizing pampering afforded the Chinese by the developed world, and partly because of China’s relentless, but successful, manipulation of world opinion, China has long been treated as being ”exceptional” when it comes to its international behavior.
As a result, in venues like the United Nations, China enjoys a degree of immunity from criticism for its egregious human rights abuses, as well as for its massive military build-up, one that is unparalleled in recent experience.
Likewise, China’s relations with authoritarian regimes, or even its responsibility for preserving the global environment, are rarely mentioned.
Indeed, China was not asked to bear anything like its rightful share of the burden in curbing carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
Unsurprisingly, China’s pampered leadership now acts as if the country actually is exceptional and can get away with polluting outer space without rebuke.
The destruction of the Chinese satellite produced roughly 300,000 pieces of debris, causing severe pollution and putting many other spacecraft in the Earth’s orbit in grave danger.
We know this because the last and only time anybody “killed” a satellite with a land-based missile was in 1985, when the US destroyed one of its own satellites, creating a slick of debris that took the American government 17 years to clean up.
There is a danger, given China’s size, that this peculiar “Chinese Exceptionalism” could turn into something truly alarming: a global norm.
For China’s effort to make Internet giants like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft kowtow to its domestic political controls, and its push in Africa and Latin America to create blocs of nations that pursue economic development while ignoring human rights and environmental conservation, is a poor model for the developing world.
In fact, China’s courtship of resource-rich Third World tyrannies and its recent step toward the weaponization of outer space undermines its carefully crafted new image as a paragon of “harmonious” social development.
So to continue to give China “exceptional” treatment given today’s Chinese behavior will undermine its ability to become a nation capable of exercising responsible global leadership.
.
Last week, Russia and China held joint military maneuvers in the presence of both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao.
But a new strategic alliance between the two countries is not likely, as it is China that poses the greatest strategic threat to Russia, although many in the Kremlin seem blind to this as they rattle sabers at America and the West.
Indeed, China officially considers several regions in Russia’s Far East to be only “alienated” from it.
China’s territorial claims on Russia are often noted in Chinese grade school geography textbooks, which include a number of Russian Far Eastern regions within China’s borders.
This is consistent with the Chinese strategic concept of “vital space,” which includes all spheres of a state’s strategic activities, on land, at sea, under water, in the air, and in space.
The dimensions of “vital space” are determined by a country’s economic, scientific, technical, social, and military capabilities – in essence, its “total power.”
According to Chinese theorists, the “vital space” of great powers extends far beyond a state’s borders, whereas the “vital space” of weak countries is limited to strategic boundaries that do not always correspond to the borders of their national territory.
Today, China has territorial claims against 11 of its 24 neighbors, including India, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, in addition to Russia.
In China’s relations with all of them, the potential use of military force was and remains an important factor.
In September 2006, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted an unprecedentedly large 10-day exercise, involving the Shenyang and Beijing military districts, the two most powerful of China’s seven military districts.
Shenyang abuts the Russian Armed Forces’ Far Eastern District, and the Beijing district shares a border with Russia’s Siberian Military District.
During the exercises, Shenyang units advanced 1,000 kilometers into the Beijing district, where they engaged in joint war games.
To military observers, the Beijing/Shenyang exercises seemed to be practice for a possible offensive operation against Russia, because exercises on such a scale are undertaken only at the final stage of a multi-year program to train troops to enact specific strategic and operational plans.
The geography of the exercises, and the offensive nature of the tasks undertaken, leaves little doubt that Russia was cast in the role of “potential adversary.”
Such a show of force is an ancient, traditional Chinese political technique.
Paradoxically, these exercises were undertaken during a period when bilateral political and economic ties appeared on the surface to be at their highest point.
Russia has an important place in Chinese geopolitical calculations, as a supplier of both modern weaponry and energy resources needed to continue its modernization.
Therefore, the Chinese are doing everything possible to strengthen their economic and political position in Russia, and to draw Russia into their sphere of influence.
And China is succeeding, most importantly by consistently reinforcing Putin’s anti-American and anti-Western agenda.
While Beijing/Shenyang exercise should have indicated to Russian leaders that China’s intentions toward Russia may not always be benign, Russia’s political and military leadership seem not to sense any threat; on the contrary, they continue to sell the Chinese advanced weapons.
Russia’s current diplomatic tilt, indeed, is clearly against its own long-term national security interests.
China will never be interested in Russia’s economic and political modernization, for it prefers Russia to remain a source of mineral and energy resources and a vast “strategic rear” in its looming challenge with the United States.
Likewise, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which just concluded its annual meeting, is in China’s eyes a tool of regional policy that helps strengthen China’s influence and control over Central Asia’s natural resources at the expense of Russia.
No nation threatens China’s land borders.
China can solve its domestic problems, such as separatism, by itself.
China is militarily self-sufficient and needs military cooperation under the SCO framework only in order to free its hands if any conflict should arise that affects its interests.
In fact, conflict between Russia and China is possible precisely in Central Asia, given the clear differences in the two countries’ economic and political interests in that region.
Aside from control of the region’s energy supplies, water has become a potential source of conflict, given China’s serious shortages.
Yet, while the Chinese clearly understand these contingencies and are preparing themselves to deal with them diplomatically and militarily, the Kremlin remains myopically obsessed with the phantom threat of America.
Thus, as the Kremlin dreams of re-establishing its domination over what Russians refer to as the “near abroad” (Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic countries, and the other post-Soviet states), China is increasingly looking at Russia as its own “near abroad.”
Will the Kremlin finally wake up to this?
Thirty-six years ago, Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong turned world politics upside down, as both America and China realized that it was the Soviet Union, and not each other, that posed the greater threat.
Vladimir Putin needs his own “Nixon moment.”
Alienating the West is a foolish strategy when the greatest long term threat to Russia comes from the East.
MOSCOW – When the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games begins in a few days, viewers will be presented with a minutely choreographed spectacle swathed in nationalist kitsch.
Of course, images that recall Hitler’s goose-stepping storm troopers are the last thing that China’s leaders have in mind for their Olympics; after all, official Chinese nationalism proclaims the country’s “peaceful rise” within an idyll of “harmonious development.”
But, both aesthetically and politically, the parallel is hardly far-fetched.
Indeed, by choosing Albert Speer Jr., the son of Hitler’s favorite architect and the designer of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, to design the master plan for the Beijing Games, China’s government has itself alluded to the radical politicization of aesthetics that was a hallmark of twentieth-century totalitarianism.
Like those regimes, whether fascist or communist, China’s leaders have sought to transform public space and sporting events into visible proof of their fitness and mandate to rule.
Speer Jr.’s commission was to lay out a master plan for the access to the Olympic complex in Beijing.
His design centered on the construction of an imposing avenue to connect the Forbidden City and the National Stadium in which the opening ceremony will take place.
His father’s plan for “Germania,” the name Hitler selected for the Berlin that he planned to construct after World War II, also relied on such a mighty central axis.
China’s rulers see the Olympics as a stage for demonstrating to the world the exceptional vitality of the country they have built over the past three decades.
And that demonstration serves an even more important domestic political objective: further legitimizing the regime’s continuing rule in the eyes of ordinary Chinese.
Given this imperative, an architectural language of bombast and gigantism was almost inevitable.
So it is no surprise that the Beijing Games may resemble the hubristic Games that beguiled the Führer and enthralled the German masses in 1936.
Like the Beijing Games, the Berlin Olympics were conceived as a coming-out party.
Josef Goebbels’ Nazi propaganda machine was fully deployed.
Athletic imagery – used to brilliant effect in Leni Riefenstahl’s acclaimed documentary – appeared to create a link between the Nazis and the ancient Greeks, and to confirm the Nazi myth that Germans and German civilization were the true heirs to the “Aryan” culture of classical antiquity.
While designing the master plan for the Beijing Games, Speer Jr., an acclaimed architect and town planner, also sought, like his father, to create a futuristic global metropolis.
Of course, the language that he used to sell his scheme to the Chinese was very different from the words his father used to present his plans to Hitler.
Instead of emphasizing his design’s pomposity, the younger Speer insisted on its environmental friendliness.
The 2,000-year-old city of Beijing should be transported into hyper-modernity, whereas his father’s 1936 Berlin design was, in his words, “simply megalomania.”
Of course, the sins of the father should never be visited on the son.
But, in this case, when the son borrows essential elements of his father’s architectural principles and serves a regime that seeks to use the Games for some of the same reasons that animated Hitler, is he not willingly reflecting those sins?
Totalitarian regimes – the Nazis, the Soviets in 1980, and now the Chinese – desire to host the Olympics as a way to signal to the world their superiority.
China believes that it has found its own model to develop and modernize, and its rulers regard the Games in the same way as the Nazis and Leonid Brezhnev did, as a means of “selling” their model to a global audience.
Obviously, the Chinese were politically tone-deaf in choosing an architect whose name carried such dark historical connotations.
The name of Speer itself probably did not matter to the officials who chose him.
They sought to stage an Olympics that made manifest their image of themselves, and Speer Jr., looking back to his father’s mastery of the architecture of power, delivered the goods.
The realization of Speer Jr.’s Olympic vision, and that of his patrons, marks the end of a welcome interlude.
For years following the end of the Cold War, politics had been removed from the Games.
A gold medal signified the sporting abilities and dedication of individual athletes, not the supposed merits of the political system that produced them.
But now we have returned to an aesthetic of political mesmerization, reflected in the host government’s declared aim that China should win more gold medals than any country before.
As the Olympic torch relay – itself a creation of the Nazis, first employed in the Berlin Games – makes its way down Speer Jr.’s avenue of power, the world will once again be made to witness a triumph of the totalitarian will.
NEW HAVEN – In early March, China’s National People’s Congress will approve its 12th Five-Year Plan.
This Plan is likely to go down in history as one of China’s boldest strategic initiatives.
In essence, it will change the character of China’s economic model – moving from the export- and investment-led structure of the past 30 years toward a pattern of growth that is driven increasingly by Chinese consumers.
This shift will have profound implications for China, the rest of Asia, and the broader global economy.
Like the Fifth Five-Year Plan, which set the stage for the “reforms and opening up” of the late 1970’s, and the Ninth Five-Year Plan, which triggered the marketization of state-owned enterprises in the mid-1990’s, the upcoming Plan will force China to rethink the core value propositions of its economy.
Premier Wen Jiabao laid the groundwork four years ago, when he first articulated the paradox of the “Four ‘Uns’” – an economy whose strength on the surface masked a structure that was increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and ultimately unsustainable.”
The Great Recession of 2008-2009 suggests that China can no longer afford to treat the Four Uns as theoretical conjecture.
The post-crisis era is likely to be characterized by lasting aftershocks in the developed world – undermining the external demand upon which China has long relied.
That leaves China’s government with little choice other than to turn to internal demand and tackle the Four Uns head on.
The 12th Five-Year Plan will do precisely that, focusing on three major pro-consumption initiatives.
First, China will begin to wean itself from the manufacturing model that has underpinned export- and investment-led growth.
While the manufacturing approach served China well for 30 years, its dependence on capital-intensive, labor-saving productivity enhancement makes it incapable of absorbing the country’s massive labor surplus.
Instead, under the new Plan, China will adopt a more labor-intensive services model.
It will, one hopes, provide a detailed blueprint for the development of large-scale transactions-intensive industries such as wholesale and retail trade, domestic transport and supply-chain logistics, health care, and leisure and hospitality.
Such a transition would provide China with much greater job-creating potential.
With the employment content of a unit of Chinese output more than 35% higher in services than in manufacturing and construction, China could actually hit its employment target with slower GDP growth.
Moreover, services are far less resource-intensive than manufacturing – offering China the added benefits of a lighter, cleaner, and greener growth model.
The new Plan’s second pro-consumption initiative will seek to boost wages.
The main focus will be the lagging wages of rural workers, whose per capita incomes are currently only 30% of those in urban areas – precisely the opposite of China’s aspirations for a more “harmonious society.”
Among the reforms will be tax policies aimed at boosting rural purchasing power, measures to broaden rural land ownership, and technology-led programs to raise agricultural productivity.
But the greatest leverage will undoubtedly come from policies that foster ongoing and rapid migration from the countryside to the cities.
Since 2000, annual rural-to-urban migration has been running consistently at 15-20 million people.
For migration to continue at this pace, China will have to relax the long-entrenched strictures of its hukou, or household registration system, which limits labor-market flexibility by tethering workers and their benefits to their birthplace.
Boosting employment via services, and lifting wages through enhanced support for rural workers, will go a long way toward raising Chinese personal income, now running at just 42% of GDP – half that of the United States.
But more than higher growth in income from labor will be needed to boost Chinese private consumption.
Major efforts to shift from saving toward spending are also required.
That issue frames the third major component of the new Plan’s pro-consumption agenda – the need to build a social safety net in order to reduce fear-driven precautionary saving.
Specifically, that means social security, private pensions, and medical and unemployment insurance – plans that exist on paper but are woefully underfunded.
For example, in 2009, China’s retirement-system assets – national social security, local government retirement benefit plans, and private sector pensions – totaled just RMB2.4 trillion ($364 billion).
That boils down to only about $470 of lifetime retirement benefits for the average Chinese worker.
Little wonder that families save out of fear of the future.  China’s new Plan must rectify this shortfall immediately.
There will be far more to the 12th Five-Year Plan than these three pillars of pro-consumption policy.
The Plan’s focus on accelerated development of several strategic emerging industries – from biotech and alternative energy to new materials and next-generation information technology – is also noteworthy.
But the emphasis on the Chinese consumer is likely to be the new Plan’s defining feature – sufficient, in my opinion, to boost private consumption as a share of Chinese GDP from its current rock-bottom reading of around 36% to somewhere in the 42-45% range by 2015.
While still low by international standards, such an increase would nonetheless represent a critical step for China on the road to rebalancing.
It would also be a huge boost for China’s major trading partners – not just those in East Asia, but also growth-constrained European and US economies.
Indeed, the 12th Five-Year Plan is likely to spark the greatest consumption story in modern history.
Today’s post-crisis world could hardly ask for more.
But there is a catch: in shifting to a more consumption-led dynamic, China will reduce its surplus saving and have less left over to fund the ongoing saving deficits of countries like the US.
The possibility of such an asymmetrical global rebalancing – with China taking the lead and the developed world dragging its feet – could be the key unintended consequence of China’s 12th Five-Year Plan.
The Chinese government's participation in the United States-led war against terrorism is based on their real fear of internationally coordinated Islamic terrorism in China.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Uyghur separatist organizations, such as the Eastern Turkestan Information Center and the Uyghur Liberation Front, of being responsible for attacks ranging from the bombing of the Chinese consulate in Istanbul to a March 1997 bus bombing in Beijing.
Now, the Chinese government seeks international support for their domestic crackdown on the Uyghur separatists who they claim have direct links to the Taliban and bin Laden's Islamist inspired organizations.
However, no international Uyghur organization listed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledges any responsibility for these earlier violent actions, and since September 11th, most of their expatriate information centers have disclaimed any support for international or domestic violence.
Interestingly, in his last officially broadcast television interview, Osama bin Laden gave his backing to several Islamic liberation struggles, yet he failed to mention the Uyghur independence movement.
Taliban-trained Uyghurs have fought against the Northern Alliance and actively participated in the Chechen Muslim struggle against Russian rule.
In the mid- to late-1990s, international Uyghur organizations claimed indirect responsibility for numerous ``acts of resistance'' against Chinese rule, including bombings of police stations in Kashgar and Khotan, bus bombings in Urumqi and Beijing, and large uprisings in Yining (Khulja), Aktush, and Kashgar.
Nevertheless, though the Chinese government seeks to demonstrate that the Uyghur are a growing domestic threat, they have been unable to cite any recent incidents of domestic Uyghur-related violence.
In the 1950s, the Uyghur and other local populations welcomed the entrance of the People's Liberation Army in what was recognized as a ``peaceful liberation'' of both Xinjiang and Tibet.
In Xinjiang, the locals willingly participated in the political redistribution of land and wealth and looked forward to the end of a three-way civil war that had trapped the region between competing Russian, Chinese Communist, and Chinese Nationalist interests.
Simultaneously, continuing ethnic tensions between Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, and Han Chinese threatened to tear the region apart along local and tribal lines.
Life changed dramatically in Xinjiang when it, like Tibet, was swept up in the nation-wide leftist and Maoist struggle-campaigns that culminated in the 10-year Cultural Revolution and from 1966-76 wreaked havoc on the entire country.
During this period, domestic migration to Xinjiang was encouraged to ``open the West'' (kaifa xibu), and ``local nationalism'' (difang minzu zhuyi) was repressed.
By 1982, the Han Chinese population stood at 38 percent, while the Uyghurs held a slim majority of 42 percent in their own ``autonomous'' region.
The mid-1980s and late 1990s saw an increased local response to the shifting dynamics of Chinese rule.
Ethnic intellectuals expressed support for Deng Xiaoping's repudiation of radical Maoist politics and the Cultural Revolution.
The media regularly championed Deng's ``market Leninism,'' which sought to loosen state control over economic reform while preserving central power over all political matters.
The relaxation of restrictions on religious and ethnic expression resulted in an explosion of Islamic rituals, mosque building, pilgrimages to Mecca and religious education, and ``ethnic'' festivals spread throughout the social landscape.
In 1991, swelling Uyghur pride in their history and distinct ethno-religious traditions led to ill-founded hopes that with the end of the Soviet Union, the independence of the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia would be extended to China, establishing if not an independent ``Uyghuristan,'' at least perhaps a unified ``Eastern Turkestan,'' that would stand alongside Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan as independent Turkic republics.
However, the Uyghur desire for independence met with stiff Chinese resistance.
Compounded by the deepening integration of the region through Chinese migration and extractive development policies, Uyghur protests erupted throughout the late 1990s, eventually leading to isolated bombings, attacks on Uyghur sympathizers to Chinese rule, and violent responses to Chinese police actions against illegal social gatherings and activities.
Such expressions of rebellion were met with swift and severe Chinese crackdowns, culminating in the ``strike hard'' campaign of 1998.
Presently, diminishing Uyghur activism and decreasing political protests suggest a shift toward withdrawal.
Uyghur membership in the Chinese Communist Party has declined, despite a nationwide increase in membership due to CCP placement of supporters in universities and lucrative jobs in the state and semi-private sectors.
Government officials and local newspapers complain of a 20% return rate of Xinjiang students who seek training in other parts of China, amounting to domestic ``brain drain.''
Reports from recent immigrants carried on Uyghur websites around the globe suggest an increasing disenchantment and desire to emigrate.
As the Chinese government seeks international backing for its crackdown on terrorism, local Uyghurs seem less inclined to voice their frustrations than ever before.
This will mean fewer sources of information for a government that hopes to build support for its development goals in the region.
In a ``market Leninist'' system, only economic development can resolve ethnic and class-based tensions.
Yet, withdrawal from participation in that development program may result in ethnic tension and even radicalization of certain dispossessed young Uyghur males.
This pool of frustrated talent may prove fertile ground to international terrorist organizations seeking support for their extremist agendas.
China's ``strike hard'' campaign has done little but alienate its local ethnic populations.
Its war against terrorism must be combined with a policy that gives them hope.
A contest for China’s soul is now underway in that giant country, pitting two powerful forces and two very different stances toward the outside world against each other.
The outcome will have a major impact on whether China succeeds in becoming a nation capable of having truly constructive and durable relations with the outside world.
On one hand, China’s economic revolution has helped position it in the world as a confident powerhouse of trade, a more responsible global powerbroker, and even as a reassuring military presence.
On the other hand, China remains trapped by a past and a mindset steeped in a sense of victimization, which tempts it to export blame for internal problems.
The main question is whether China can escape the pull of this old psychological syndrome – which kept it preoccupied throughout the twentieth century with debilitating sentiments of weakness, insecurity, and humiliation – and allow itself to be guided by a new outlook on the world, and even on old enemies.
The anti-Japanese demonstrations are a symptom of the old syndrome, fueled by grievances born at a time when China was, indeed, aggrieved and humiliated.
With China’s growing economic clout, rising standard of living, and increasingly respected place in the world, one would hope that the Chinese and their leaders would find a way to let go of the dead.
Yet, even as the luster of the “China miracle” dazzles the world, the Chinese seem loath leave behind their dark feelings of victimization.
Instead of assuming a new national paradigm based on the reality of their accomplishments (national unity, robust international trade, and growing global influence), China’s leaders cling to the old paradigm of their country as victim, the “sick man of Asia” being “cut up like a melon” by predatory imperial and colonial powers like Japan.
That bitter memory of oppression and exploitation lingers in the minds of too many Chinese like the afterimage of a bright light long after it has been turned off.
The Japanese occupation of China was a particularly galling and humiliating period because Japan was an Asian, not a Western, power.
Moreover, like China, Japan was a society steeped in Confucian culture, which many Chinese reformers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries blamed as a critical impediment to their own country’s development and modernization.
Of course, Japan did occupy China, committed unimaginable savagery, and has since paid no reparations or apologized in a convincing way.
Nevertheless, what benefit does China gain by continuing to raise these issues 60 years later?
What is worth the risk of alienating the world’s second largest economy and one of China’s most important trade partners?
First and foremost, aiding and inciting the expression of popular anger against Japan gives China’s Communist Party leaders a powerful and readily available vehicle for rallying domestic support, thereby legitimizing their own power.
At the same time, the demonstrations represent China’s experience of the world as an unequal place where the weak are inevitably bullied, exploited, and humiliated.
This mindset suggests that, despite the panoramic city skylines, the billboards, and the flashy five-star hotels say otherwise, China has a long way to go before it truly comes to understand and appreciate its actual accomplishments and status.
Indeed, surges of organized anger when China is attacked or insulted are hardly new.
The reaction of China’s leaders to the America’s accidental attack on China’s embassy in Belgrade in 1998, and to the collision of an American spy plane with a Chinese plane over the Pacific, was to permit, if not foment, large anti-foreign demonstrations.
In keeping with this syndrome, Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing has accused Japan of having “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people” by not apologizing for their crimes, as if he were Minister of Psychology, rather than foreign affairs.
Of course, China’s wounded psyche and the desire for restitution from its former tormentors deserve sympathy.
In this sense, China, like many countries, could be said to have something of a bi-polar personality.
Much of the emotional force of Mao’s revolution derived from the widespread sense of unequal treatment and humiliation by foreign powers, and this revolutionary fervor has never been properly interred.
Just as Mao’s portrait has never been taken down from The Gate of Heavenly Peace, so whole elements of his revolution continue to survive in China’s institutions, ways of thinking, and modes of interacting with the world.
Like recessive genes, they sometimes suddenly re-express themselves.
The role of victim is all too familiar to the Chinese, perhaps even somewhat comforting, for it provides a way to explain (and explain away) China’s problems.
But it is also dangerous, because it derives from China’s old weaknesses rather than its new strengths.
The era of Japanese militaristic and imperialist power has long gone, and the world is beating a path to China’s door.
The last thing the country needs is to remain trapped in the past.
After eight years of explosive growth, there are now almost as many internet users in China as there are members of the 70-million-strong Communist Party.
China's "information elite," the largely urban, educated, professionals who are China's internet surfers, are becoming a force of equal size to the ruling political power base.
What will this new center of power mean for the transformation of Chinese society?
Since the mid-1990s, China's government has promoted the rapid growth of the internet for its economic benefits.
But it has also been developing a sophisticated political and technological system to control online information.
The government employs a host of new legal regulations, a shadowy internet police force, and a powerful hardware-based national information filtering system.
Control also relies on the demography of internet users, most of whom belong to China's economic elite and are more likely to adopt the internet as part of a newfound consumer lifestyle than as a tool for political or social revolution.
What is surprising is that the government's control mechanisms have been largely effective.
But it is also prompting profound social changes that are rooted in a rising rights consciousness within society, something strengthened--and amplified-- not only by the growth of the economy, but by the rapid spread of the internet.
After two and a half decades of market-oriented economic reform, Chinese citizens are increasingly aware of how to protect their economic and social interests by using the language of rights. When confronting abuses of power, people are increasingly using a new term, "weiquan" (defending rights), to challenge the system.
Another new term, "zhi qing quan" (right to know), has also entered public discourse.
The new terminology inspired by the information technology revolution was especially prevalent after the SARS outbreak last spring, when the government covered up the epidemic until after it had spread throughout China and beyond.
The momentum of this rising demand in China for "rights" can also be seen in the coverage of other major events in the traditional media.
For example, when covering a natural disaster, a major industrial accident, or an urgent public health issue, journalists in the traditional media are not allowed to investigate and report without official sanction.
But the internet is helping to change these rules.
Journalists now learn how to evade government guidelines by distributing and collecting information online, making it more difficult for propaganda bosses to silence the spread of information considered "sensitive."
Ordinary internet users can also write about events they witness and broadcast their reports online, making the suppression of important breaking news almost impossible.
Moreover, the authorities have a difficult time tracking down and punishing people who spread this kind of "subversive" information--a term frequently used by the government to suppress political dissent--online.
Because Chinese internet users are now more likely to find out about a breaking story in real time and question why the official press hasn't covered it, China's conventional media now feel pressure from the public to cover events that they might otherwise dodge.
Online discussion of current events, especially through internet bulletin boards, is another new phenomenon.
One recent survey shows that the number of users registered with China's ten most popular bulletin boards, which focus on news and political affairs, range from 100,000 to 500,000.
Mainly through bulletin boards, email mailing list services and an emerging "Web log" community, the internet has begun to provide an alternative public sphere that did not exist in China a few years ago.
Under the state censorship system, most discussions are limited to politically acceptable topics, such as legal reform and anti-corruption efforts.
However, within these boundaries, internet-enabled activism, such as online petitions, have not only expanded the boundaries of traditional media reporting, but presaged some interesting new political consequences as well.
When college student Sun Zhigang was beaten to death by the police in the southern city of Guangzhou this spring, for example, it inspired a storm of online calls for "weiquan," and provoked debates over the "custody and repatriation system."
That form of "administrative detention," used primarily against migrant workers, was the basis for Sun's detention.
The online protest that ensued undoubtedly played a role in the government's decision to abolish the system and arrest the officials involved in the case.
Despite government efforts to control the internet, a space to support the rising rights consciousness within Chinese society has been carved out.
As the pervasiveness and flexibility of the new medium weakens traditional media censorship, internet-enabled social activism plays an increasingly influential role in China's legal reform and the development of its nascent civil society.
China's 70 million "netizens" may now be in a prime position to guide the transformation of society and determine the country's future.
But the outcome of this grand experiment, which pits an authoritarian government dedicated to controlling politics against an information technology inherently resistant to such controls, is far from certain.
Ultimately, what happens may tell us as much about the inherent nature of the internet in our evolving world as about a changing China.
BEIJING – A major new target in the “Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development” that China just unveiled is to boost the growth rate for household (disposable) income so that it equals the growth rate of the country’s GDP.
The reason is simple: over the past 10 years or so, China’s household income grew more slowly than GDP, making it a smaller and smaller proportion of total national income.
Many important structural problems have resulted from this trend.
Lagging household income has held back private consumption, even though the economy has the capacity to produce more consumer goods.
It has also driven up corporate savings, because firms’ earnings are growing faster than household income and (and, for that matter, faster than overall GDP).
That, in turn, may cause higher investment or asset bubbles, as businesses seek to reinvest their savings somewhere.
And lagging household income clearly contributes to China’s trade surplus, because low domestic consumption tends to keep exports higher than imports.
But there are even more problems related to China’s disproportionately small household income, particularly growing income disparity.
Indeed, not all of China’s “households” have benefited alike from rapid GDP growth.
Some social groups, such as skilled workers, engineers, and financial-sector employees, have seen their wages rise strongly.
Urbanites – people with formal registration as urban residents – have recorded income gains as well, owing to their coverage by the government-run education system and social safety net.
And, as corporate profits have grown, those who share the capital gains in one way or another have also seen their incomes increase faster than the national average.
Those with less education, however, such as migrant workers and farmers, have fared much worse.
The former earn an annual salary (including fringe benefits!) totaling $2,000; the later may earn only half that.
They comprise, in roughly equal parts, the low-income workers who account for up to 65-70% of the total workforce.
Their average income has grown, but more slowly than the 8-10% annual GDP growth rate of the past 20 years.
The target set by the new five-year plan is thus also a policy manifesto to battle these social disparities, which are now a burning issue for the country.
But why did these disparities arise in the first place?
Thirty years ago, 80% of China’s labor force was composed of farmers.
But, while that figure is down now to about 30%, rural education has continued to suffer from inadequate funding and human capital relative to urban, industrializing regions.
That caused rising inequality between the urban privileged and the rural poor.
Geographical differences and government social policies that have been more favorable to urban and industrial sectors may be also be to blame.
But the most fundamental problem is that development does not take place overnight.
It takes a long time to bring education and better-paid jobs to everyone.
During this long period, some get rich first, which means that others lag behind.
Thirty years of rapid growth brought only half of China’s famers (about 200 million people) into the industrial or service sectors, where their wages doubled.
But at least another 150 million famers are still coming into the labor market, competing for higher-paying jobs.
The old generation of farmers may stay put, but younger generations will continue to leave the land, creating a seemingly infinite supply of labor, which suppresses wages in all industries and services for lower-educated workers.
As a result, the income of almost 70% of the labor force cannot increase as fast as their labor productivity, and average household income thus cannot grow as fast as the economy as a whole.
Given China’s massive stock of “surplus labor,” this trend will not reverse itself soon.
Indeed, the situation may worsen for another decade or two before it improves.
This is why the government wants to intervene.
In recent years, the central government has increased its spending on rural compulsory education and poverty relief, and local governments have changed regulations to increase the minimum wage by 20-30% in all 30 provinces.
In the next five years, more efforts in that direction are planned.
The social-security system is to be extended to cover all workers and farmers.
Fiscal and taxation reform is to be accelerated in order to transfer more income from the corporate sector to households and public budgets for social programs, including low-rent housing for the urban poor and more and better services for new immigrants from rural areas.
But none of this will solve the problem.
The best a government plan can do is to prevent the worst.
Government subsidies may (temporarily) redress income disparity in a developed country where farmers account only for 2% of the labor force, or in a country in which low-income groups count for only 10% of the total population.
But in China, where farmers make up 30-35% of the labor force and 70% of the population falls into low-income categories, government can play only a marginal role.
In such circumstances, the old adage that the best social-welfare program is economic growth is all the more applicable.
All the lessons from developing countries from the 1950’s through the 1980’s, and recent lessons from some advanced developed countries, tell us that over-burdening social programs with too great a focus on redistribution may cause large fiscal deficits, debt crises, hyper-inflation, or financial meltdown, with the end result being not a narrowing of disparity but an enlargement.
China must keep these lessons in mind over the next 20-40 years.
Indeed, continued growth and job creation is the only real solution for lifting hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty permanently.
Nationalist sentiment has been on the rise in China for a decade.
This may be hidden from President Bush when he visits China next month, but it is there all the same.
From 1993 to 2001 a series of abrasive encounters poisoned the atmosphere: the forced boarding of a Chinese merchant ship (wrongly suspected of carrying chemical warfare components to Iran) in the Arabian Gulf; US efforts to block China's bid to host the 2000 Olympics; escalating tensions over Taiwan; the Wen Ho Lee affair (where China was falsely implicated in the theft of American nuclear secrets); the accidental bombing of China's embassy by US warplanes during the Kosovo war; and the mid-air collision of a US spy plane and a Chinese jet fighter last year.
Cumulatively, these events evoked bitter memories of 19 th century Western imperialism, when ``foreign devils'' subdued and humiliated China, running roughshod over a once-proud people.
Echoes of past humiliations were clearly evident in a spate of popular anti-American books published in the late 1990s with such inflammatory titles as ``China Cannot be Intimidated;'' ``America's Evil Schemes;'' and ``A China That Can Say NO.''
In these and other best-selling publications the 19 th century concept of guochi - ``national humiliation'' - was invoked to express China's righteous indignation at the bullying imperialists.
Nor was this a propaganda ploy, as some suggested.
Though initiated by the government, the guochi revival resonated in Chinese society.
A 1999 public opinion survey of more than 1200 university students in Beijing revealed that fully 75% of well-educated respondents agreed with the statement that, ``The [Belgrade] embassy bombing was a deliberate act of the US Government.''
By the end of the 1990s a majority of Chinese citizens regarded America as their primary adversary.
In this environment, more than a few Chinese reacted to the events of September 11 th with barely disguised satisfaction.
Equally troubling was the near-hysterical tone adopted by many Chinese netizens in the aftermath of the EP-3 incident of April 2001, when websites and chatrooms around the country were flooded with messages demanding that America be made to pay a ``blood debt'' for the death of martyred Chinese fighter pilot Wang Wei.
Evoking the self-righteous outrage of guochi , three young Chinese males engaged in the following exchange of messages on the internet:
Righteous Eagle : The US uttered a few shameful words of apology and our government released 24 pigs....
On the surface it appears that the United States apologized to China, but what commitments did the US assume, really?
They didn't agree to anything....
Who can swallow this?
We need to settle a blood debt but we just let the devils go home?
Gracious : ....My web comrades, how can we face the martyrs who have fought these past several hundred years for national self-respect and the strengthening of the country?
How can we face our ancestors?
I feel so ashamed before you....
Lin Zi ... What difference is there between the China of today and the China of one hundred years ago? ...
As our tears flow down our cheeks, I do not dare believe that this is our country, the China that gave birth to me and raised me....
I would sooner die than go on living like this.
My life belongs to my country.
Do not make the people distrust you, my motherland!
Let's wake you up.
Mother!
Your sufferings are far from over....
These rants display a second major feature of the Chinese cult of guochi : the tendency to blame a weak, feckless Chinese government for not standing up to predatory foreigners.
On many such occasions in the past, from the Boxer Rebellion to the May 4 th Movement (which culminated in the massacre at Tiananmen Square, Chinese patriots angrily accused their own government of betraying the country by colluding with foreign imperialists.
In effect, such feelings of national betrayal served to transform China's cult of national shame from a useful tool of government propaganda into a two-edged sword wielded against the government itself.
Indeed, fearful of popular backlash against its decision to release the crew of the US spyplane without securing either a meaningful American apology or adequate financial compensation, China's government quietly shut down several popular internet sites in the weeks following the spy plane incident - including the chatroom that posted the above-cited messages.
Since September 11 th , the guochi revival has abated somewhat.
In the interest of promoting Sino-American cooperation against terrorism the Chinese government has toned down the emotional content of its anti-American rhetoric. Last month, for example, the revelation that an American-made Boeing 737, specially outfitted for the use of President Jiang Zemin, was bugged with dozens of listening devices, elicited only a mild from the Chinese government.
No stoning of US embassies; no mass internet hysteria.
Some Chinese scholars now question the wisdom of allowing the bitter anti-foreignism of the 19 th century to poison China's 21 st century diplomacy.
As one influential scholar at Peking University put it: ``For Chinese diplomacy, the most important thing is to walk out of the shadow of the past 100 years of our diplomacy of humiliation and avoid either overreacting to offenses or hiding passively, and instead face the world like a big country.''
Evidently, China's top leader agrees.
Speaking last July on the occasion of the 80 th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiang Zemin proclaimed ``We Have to put an end once and for all to the... diplomacy of humiliation.''
As President Jiang prepares to meet George W. Bush later this month at their long-awaited presidential summit in Beijing, we can only hope he is right.
It is indeed time for China to put guochi to rest and ``face the world like a big country.''
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is the most important event in the country's history since the inception of its "open door" economic policy a quarter-century ago.
Trade liberalization will benefit consumers, small entrepreneurs, and foreign investors.
But for China's peasants, WTO membership appears to pose a direct and immediate threat to the tremendous gains made since Deng Xiaoping's agricultural reforms in the late 1970s.
The fear felt by China's peasants is understandable because it is deeply rooted in China's history and politics.
Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the peasantry has been the country's most under-represented and manipulated social group, bearing the brunt of the Communists' promotion of heavy industry.
But WTO membership does not come at the expense of agriculture, for it promises to erode rather than reinforce the peasantry's legacy of discrimination and powerlessness.
It is a legacy built on deception.
During China's civil war in the late 1940s, the promise of land reform attracted tens of millions of landless peasants to support the Communists.
After the founding of the People's Republic, they did receive land, only to see it taken back when the new regime embarked on its massive agricultural collectivization drive.
The harshness of the subsequent industrialization campaign culminated in the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60, producing a famine that killed 30 million people, mostly in rural areas.
By the time Mao Zedong died, in 1976, the rural economy was a shambles.
In desperation, village leaders in Anhui province initiated an experiment that returned land to peasants-a de facto privatization that violated official policy.
The government, believing that the situation in the countryside could not get worse, did not stop them.
These village experiments with private ownership were highly successful, boosting agricultural output significantly.
Indeed, it was the peasantry that fired the first shot in the reform campaign that has transformed China in the decades since.
Mindful of the bitter memory of famine (and trade embargoes), China's government remains obsessed with ensuring self-sufficiency in food.
But despite owning the means of production such as land and tools, Chinese peasants have not achieved the social and political status accorded industrial workers in state-owned sectors - people who, according to the constitution, remain the official "vanguard" class.
The government erected trade barriers and adopted other measures to protect China's agriculture, but this reflects its concern for factory workers, not-as in the US and Europe-farmers' political clout.
Inefficient and loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) remain the primary beneficiaries of official economic policy, kept alive on a drip-feed of government subsidies and cheap loans from state-owned banks.
Township and village enterprises (TVEs)-which are owned by and employ mostly former peasants-had to rely on themselves to become the most dynamic and productive sources of China's economic growth.
WTO membership will expose China's agricultural sector to foreign competition.
Rural labor will be displaced and the agricultural sector as a whole may experience net job losses.
But the WTO-induced expansion of non-agricultural labor-intensive sectors, particularly the textile and clothing industries, could absorb these workers.
Today, peasants move to seek new and better employment opportunities created by economic liberalization.
Free internal migration has become a fait accompli, effectively shunting aside China's apartheid-like system of residency permits.
WTO membership will also force the government to cease discriminating in favor of SOEs and against economic sectors with a high degree of private ownership, including agriculture.
China's industrialization strategy in the pre-reform era rejected the notion of "comparative advantage"- the principle that an economy produces some goods more efficiently than others owing to factors such as natural resources, geography, and climate.
Jamaica, say, does not produce frozen salmon or hockey players because investing in industries such as citrus fruit and tourism provides far more certain profits.
The same WTO-induced sectoral adjustment underlies the decline of steel and textiles in advanced countries such as the US.
In China, most SOEs survived because central planners emphasized economic autarky, regardless of cost.
With trade liberalization, the cost of ignoring comparative advantage soars.
China's increasing openness to global competition will eventually jeopardize the SOEs' continued survival and undermine the sustainability of politically biased development schemes.
With the entry of foreign competitors, China's state-owned banks will be forced to base lending policy on the ability of borrowers to service their debts.
The bottom line will replace the Party line in determining how investment is allocated.
With social stability the government's overwhelming priority, fundamental institutional changes are unlikely to come from within.
So accession to the WTO may be just the external catalyst China needs, promising the emergence of a level economic playing field, with respect for and protection of property rights, transparent rules and regulations, free and fair competition, and equal participation.
Although there will be pain, this should benefit many, if not most, social groups.
It will, at long last, liberate the peasantry from the greatest historical burden it bears-the dead hand of a state that dotes on its inefficient industrial proletariat.
There is nothing "virtual" about the problems China's communist rulers confront with the internet.
Although critical to China's goals of modernization and globalization, the internet threatens the political status quo.
So no surprise at the government's often schizophrenic response to it: while broadly encouraging the internet's development, some party factions seek to suppress it by arresting IT entrepreneurs and web dissidents.
Nonetheless, China's more than 35 million internet users - a number that doubles every nine months - have access to a wide variety of previously censored information, including sites that are officially banned.
Staggering changes have already occurred.
When, a little over a year ago, 42 elementary school children and teachers in impoverished Jiangxi (south central China) were killed in an explosion, China's domestic newspapers and internet sites reported the explosion as the result of an appalling child-labor scheme: nine-year-old children had been forced to install detonators in firecrackers so that teachers could sell fireworks to supplement their salaries.
Two days later, Premier Zhu Rongji denied the reports.
He claimed that the explosion was the result of a "deranged man."
Typical of China, state-owned media that carried the original story instantly retracted their reports to parrot the party line.
Atypical of China, however, the true story refused to die.
In internet forums and chat rooms, Chinese citizens continued to express their outrage about what they saw as a government cover up.
Evidence that party leaders were lying, including interviews with witnesses, was posted on the net.
Some websites deleted the information, others refused.
Links to obscure websites with uncensored news about the catastrophe could even be found on the government newspaper's official website, People's Daily.
A few days later, the breaking news from China was astonishing. "Responding to reports on the internet and elsewhere, Premier Zhu Rongji apologized for an explosion that gutted an elementary school in rural China," read a report.
Zhu said that the government bore "unshirkable responsibility" for the imbroglio and ordered an investigation.
The turnaround was unprecedented.
Premier Zhu apologized primarily in response to the public outcry on the internet.
Though still in its infancy, the internet has shown that it has the power to shake China loose from its stagnant, isolated and repressive past.
Historically, information in China was controlled by the Communist Party, making popular opinion irrelevant.
Now the internet provides ordinary Chinese what they never had before: uncensored information. A voice.
So the Communist Party is trapped in the internet, because the government cannot pull the plug on it without hamstringing the economy.
Furthermore, China will probably need to ease up on the restrictions it has already imposed if it wants to gain all of the internet's benefits; that is, unless the conservative factions who feel most threatened by the internet consolidate their power in the upcoming leadership succession.
When I first visited China a few years ago, US President Clinton had just departed Beijing, where he charmed the Chinese people in an historic televised discussion with President Jiang Zemin.
Since the April 2001 US-China spy-plane crisis, when China demanded an apology and US President Bush refused to give one, the Bush administration has been alienating the Chinese.
The implications go beyond public relations.
The Communist Party is preparing to change its old-guard leadership over the next two years.
Hardliners who feel most threatened by the internet's free flow of information were the people emboldened by the nationalistic waves of anti-American sentiment that swept China.
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on America on September 11, angry and vengeful messages appeared in some Chinese chat rooms. "I'm glad that the USA was attacked," read one.
"Airplanes? Why not atomic bombs," read another.
Were these the xenophobic rants of extremist rightists or did they reflect a majority sentiment of the Chinese?
In China, like the US, reactionary groups often congregate on line, but with one important difference.
In China, only the educated and relatively privileged can take part in online discussion.
Thus, they can't all be written off as a purely lunatic fringe.
For the first time, as the explosion at Jaingxu school and the response to the attacks of September 11 th proved, China's public can use the internet to both gain information and express views that may influence the government.
Now that popular opinion is emerging as a force in China, the Chinese people as well as its government will need to be wooed by those wishing to influence China.
The internet has provided ordinary Chinese with access to the real story as well as to a public voice, which means that they can be a powerful ally in efforts to effect change in the most populace nation on earth.
LONDON – The Chinese financial system’s evolution in recent years has been extraordinary.
I have observed its transformation as a member of the International Advisory Council of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).
Back in 2002, all of China’s major banks were awash in non-performing loans (NPLs), which in some cases amounted to more than 10% of the total balance sheet.
None of the major banks met even the Basel 1 standards for capital adequacy.
Few financiers in London or New York could have named any bank other than Bank of China, which was often wrongly thought to be the central bank.
And to suggest that the United States Federal Reserve, or the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority, might have anything to learn from China’s financial authorities would have been thought absurd.
Less than a decade later, much has changed.
The old NPL problem was resolved, primarily by establishing asset-management companies to take over doubtful assets, and injecting new capital into the commercial banks.
Now, reported NPLs amount to little more than 1% of assets.
Foreign partners have been brought in to transfer skills, and minority shareholdings have been floated.
Current valuations put four Chinese banks in the global top ten by market capitalization.
They are now expanding overseas, fortified by their strong capital backing.
Of course, challenges remain.
Even in China there is no magic potion that can revive a loan to a defunct exporter.
And China’s big banks have lent large sums, willingly or otherwise, to local governments for infrastructure projects – many of them of dubious economic value.
There is an ever-present risk that the property market might one day collapse, though banks would emerge in better shape than have banks in the US and the UK, because much speculative investment has been funded with cash, or with only modest leverage.
The authorities in Beijing, especially the CBRC and the People’s Bank of China (the real central bank), have a good record of managing incipient booms and busts, and I would not bet against their success this time.
They have considerable flexibility, owing to a range of policy tools, including variable capital and reserve requirements and direct controls on mortgage lending terms.
They have already been tightening the screws on credit growth for several months, with positive effects.
It would be flattering to think that this turnaround in China’s financial system been attributable to the wise counsels of foreign advisers.
But, while external influences have been helpful in some ways – the stimulus of Basel 1 and 2 strengthened the hands of those in Beijing determined to clean up the banking system – the Chinese now, not unreasonably, treat advice from the City of London and Wall Street with some skepticism.
For example, recent criticism of Asian regulators by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is viewed across the region with scorn, not to mention incredulity.
A little more humility is in order, given US regulators’ performance in the run-up to the crisis.
People who live in glass houses should not throw even rhetorical stones.
The most interesting development is that we can now see increasing convergence in the regulatory philosophies and toolkits in Beijing, London, and New York.
Until the recent near-implosion of Western capitalism, the North Atlantic authorities thought that the end of financial history had been reached.
Financial conditions could be controlled with one tool – the short-term interest rate – deployed exclusively in pursuit of a target, implicit or explicit, for consumer price inflation.
Banks’ capital-adequacy ratios were set globally, and, once set, remained fixed.
Otherwise, the market knew best.
Banks had their own incentives to lend wisely, and controls on lending would necessarily prove ineffective.
By contrast, in China, all aspects of a bank’s business were directly overseen.
Indeed, most banks were under the sway of the central bank.
Now, in Beijing, officials see the advantages of a more hands-off approach, and of institutions with a primarily commercial focus.
But they have not eschewed the use of variable capital and reserve requirements, loan-to-deposit ratios, and thresholds for minimum deposits and maximum leverage as controls on property lending.
Meanwhile, in developed capital markets, we are busily reinventing these “macroprudential instruments,” to use the term now in vogue in Basel.
We can now see the utility of a more flexible toolkit to respond to excessive credit expansion, or asset-price bubbles, where the manipulation of short-term interest rates can be a blunt instrument or, worse, a double-edged sword.
An interest-rate rise might take the heat out of the mortgage market, but it will also chill the rest of the economy.
Regulatory philosophies are converging, too.
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s famous injunction that “you cannot buck the market” was part of the regulatory mindset in the pre-crisis Anglosphere.
And former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan resisted any attempts to rein in the animal spirits of the wealth creators on Wall Street.
The Chinese were less ideological.
They had no compunction about calling a bubble a bubble, or in intervening to deflate it.
Now, only Sarah Palin reveres Thatcher’s views on all issues, and Greenspan has been airbrushed out of financial history, Chinese-style.
When the G-7 morphed into the G-20 in early 2009, many were understandably worried that, with such a diverse range of participants, coming from such different traditions, it would be difficult to achieve consensus on regulatory matters in the Basel Committee and elsewhere.
These concerns turned out to have been overstated.
The elements of a broader consensus on the future role of financial regulation are in place, as long as Americans like Geithner can resist their constant desire to tell the rest of the world to do as they say, not as they do.
BRUSSELS – America’s riveting presidential election campaign may be garnering all the headlines, but a leadership struggle is also underway in Europe.
Right now, all eyes are on the undeclared frontrunners to become the first appointed president of the European Council.
Nobody – not even people closely involved in the process – really knows how the European Union’s leaders are chosen.
There are no formal rules, much less elections; somehow, names just surface in the media to become part of the EU’s mysterious internal bargaining system.
In fact, there are five jobs up for grabs, so a complex but secretive discussion is being conducted between Europe’s chancelleries over who might do what without disturbing the delicate balances between political families or between large and small states.
At the heart of this process is the even touchier issue of whether the people who will take charge of the EU’s main institutions should be strong leaders.
In principle, everyone wants heavy-hitters; in practice, many national leaders resist the idea of a more independent and assertive team in Brussels.
The dilemma is neatly summed-up by the two clear candidates for the top job as “Mr. Europe.”
On the one hand, there’s the safe pair of hands personified by Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran prime minister of tiny Luxembourg, who knows the ins and outs of the EU’s political machinery and chairs the euro zone’s ministerial set-up.
He won’t make waves, but he won’t make headlines either.
Then there’s Tony Blair.
World famous but controversial, Blair is capable of rallying public opinion and giving the European project the high profile that the EU craves.
But he’s also liable to turn a 30-month ceremonial post as the EU’s figurehead into one with much more political clout than its 27 national leaders might like.
The other four posts will probably be decided as part of a package deal, owing to the need to achieve some sort of balance.
First, there’s the question of whether the European Commission’s current president, former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso, should get another five-year term.
His early promise to be the EU executive body’s new broom has turned into a steady-as-she-goes captaincy, and there’s the added question of whether his re-appointment might turn the job into a standard 10-year post for his successors, regardless of their abilities.
The choice for No. 3 job – the foreign policy supremo who will have extra resources and powers to build on the position created by Javier Solana – looks more straightforward.
Solana, the soft- spoken Spaniard who was previously NATO’s secretary-general, looks like the odds-on favorite to take the new job for a few months before handing it over to Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister and ex-premier who gained international stature in the Balkans in the 1990’s.
But nothing is certain.
If Denmark’s prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen were to succeed as a compromise candidate between Juncker and Blair, as is widely suggested, the presence of two center-right Scandinavians would present a problem.
The remaining two posts, president of the European Parliament and the “Mr. Euro” job currently held by Juncker, will also have to contribute to overall balance and reflect the outcome of the European Parliament elections in mid-2009.
The parliament is a further wild card in this wholly undemocratic and unpredictable process.
Under the Reform Treaty – the look-alike successor to the controversial European constitution that creates the post of EU president – the parliament’s 785 members will also have their say.
In years past, only governments could torpedo candidates for Europe’s top jobs, but now the parliament also will be able to reject them.
It’s not at all clear which will have the greater power to decide the outcome.
This uncertainty is beginning to focus attention on the fundamental question of whether the EU can continue to choose its leaders in such a strange and furtive manner.
When the Union was smaller and more modest, inter-governmental horse-trading seemed acceptable, not least because national politicians could downplay the importance of “Europe.”
Today, with the EU eager to play a forceful role on the world stage, a move towards a more open system appears to be inevitable. The EU’s interlocutors in Washington, Beijing, and elsewhere already make it plain that national leaders claiming to speak for Europe lack credibility, as do EU leaders who so evidently have no convincing political mandate.
Two clearly defined schools of thought are emerging.
There are those who argue that these are sensitive and complicated issues beyond most voters’ understanding, and that more democracy would result in either populism or embarrassingly widespread abstentions.
Others believe the EU cannot continue being run along the same lines as in Beijing or even Pyongyang. It’s an issue that will confront any new team chosen by the old methods.
NEW YORK – Sooner than expected, the International Monetary Fund will have a new managing director.
For more than a decade, I have criticized the Fund’s governance, symbolized by the way its leader is chosen.
By gentlemen’s agreement among the majority shareholders – the G-8 – the managing director is to be a European, with Americans in the number two post and at the head of the World Bank.
The Europeans typically picked their nominee behind the scenes, as did the Americans, after only cursory consultation with developing countries.
The outcome, however, was often not good for the IMF, the World Bank, or the world.
Most notorious was the appointment of Paul Wolfowitz, one of the main architects of the Iraq War, to lead the World Bank.
His judgments there were no better than those that got the United States involved in that disastrous adventure.
Having placed fighting corruption at the top of the Bank’s agenda, he left in the middle of his term, accused of favoritism.
Finally, as a new order seemed to emerge in the aftermath of the US-made Great Recession, the G-20 agreed (or so it was thought) that the next IMF head would be chosen in an open and transparent manner.
The presumption was that the outcome of such a process almost surely would be a managing director from an emerging-market country.
After all, the IMF’s main responsibility is to fight crises, most of which have been in developing countries – more than a hundred since the disastrous policies of financial deregulation and liberalization began some 30 years ago.
There were many heroes of these battles in the emerging markets.
Crises need to be carefully managed.
In 1997, the mismanagement of the East Asia crisis by the IMF and the US Treasury transformed downturns into recessions, and recessions into depressions.
The world cannot afford to repeat that performance.
Today, the imminent crisis is in Europe, where the European Central Bank seems to be putting its own balance sheet and those of European banks – loaded with debt from Ireland, Greece, and Portugal – above the well-being of these countries’ citizens.
This debt almost surely needs to be restructured, but, having allowed the banks to leverage themselves beyond any level of prudence and load up on toxic derivatives, the ECB is now warning against any sort of restructuring or write-down.
But it is a bit late for the ECB to describe debt restructuring as “unthinkable.”
The ECB should have done some thinking before it let this state of affairs arise.
Indeed, more than thinking, it should have done some regulating to prevent Europe’s banks from becoming so vulnerable.
Now the ECB needs to think about how to help everyone, not just the bankers who bought the bonds.
The new thinking should put people first, and banks’ shareholders and bondholders second.
Even if the shareholders and bondholders lose everything, with the right restructuring, we can still save the banks and protect taxpayers and workers.
Where the IMF’s next managing director will come down on this issue – and on whether fiscal salvation is to be achieved through austerity, with costs borne by ordinary citizens, even as bankers get only a mild slap on the wrist – is critically important, but hard to predict.
Despite the failure of the IMF’s strategy in East Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere, it still has adherents, even within the emerging markets.
The leadership contest has turned out differently from what many had expected.
Some of the most qualified candidates (in both developed and developing countries) have not received the support of their own governments that the political process seems to require.
Other qualified people from emerging markets have been reluctant to put their hats into the ring – it is a brutal job, with a travel schedule that requires physical stamina to match wisdom and experience.
Much as I would like to see someone from the emerging markets and the developing world head the IMF, the first priority is to choose a leader with the requisite skills, commitments, and understandings in an open and transparent process, someone who will continue along the reform path on which the Fund has embarked.
Realpolitik might mean that there will be senior people from both China and the US in the top management team, but the presumption that the number two position should be filled by an American also has to go.
Whatever the outcome, the IMF, the World Bank, and the international community need to reaffirm their commitment to an open and transparent process – and ask how that process can be improved.
For example, rather than nominations from governments, which often are reluctant to support excellent candidates from opposition parties, an international nominating committee could put forward names.
Similarly, changes in voting procedures (public voting by countries, rather than through constituencies, or a requirement that candidates win the support of a majority of developing and emerging countries) could persuade more emerging-market officials to put their names forward.
What we are seeing now – open campaigning, as opposed to selection behind closed doors – seems to be a move in the right direction.
But one hopes that campaign promises won’t tie the new leader’s hands, as so often happens in electoral politics.
Simplistic ideologies got the world into the mess in which it now finds itself, and simplistic prescriptions (even of the “tough-love austerity” form) will only compound the problems.
One of the leading candidates to be the IMF’s next managing director has turned out to be a Frenchwoman, Christine Lagarde, who, as France’s finance minister, helped lead her country through the Great Recession.
She has been an outspoken advocate of financial-sector reforms, and has won the respect of all of those with whom she has worked.
Politics is not always kind to good candidates.
The world should be thankful that there is at least one.
Where she was born should not be an impediment to her prospects.
STOCKHOLM – The Nordic countries’ economies are performing well, and a part of the reason is that they are gradually reforming their “social model,” adapting it to new realities in ways that respond to people’s demands.
But there is nothing uniquely “Nordic” about this change.
On the contrary, it is one that others can emulate. 
Obviously, such a policy requires significant investment in research and development.
Sweden, for example, invests more than any other European country in this area – well above the EU target of 3% of GDP.
Many countries invest less, and even Sweden’s 4% of GDP might not be enough, given higher spending on R&amp;D in China, India, and the United States. 
Moreover, large investments in R&amp;D may be of limited use if knowledge can’t be transformed into successful businesses.
That requires adopting policies that cover everything from kindergarten training to collaboration between universities and companies, as well as an overall business climate in which success is rewarded and failure is not treated as a human catastrophe.
America’s success is to a great extent based on this kind of thinking.
Unfortunately, most European educational systems are based on outdated practices and theories.
Although educational possibilities and structures have gradually been diversified, the major shortcoming of most European educational systems remains: students have too few choices, and teachers, if they want to remain in their profession, must adhere to a severely compartmentalized pedagogy.
As with corporate monopolies, the consumers (students) are often seen as a homogeneous mass, where all students can be educated according to the same pedagogical approach.
But schools must be able to meet the needs and abilities of individual children in a way that makes learning a stimulating adventure. 
Other countries might find Sweden’s system worth studying.
Its schools are financed by local communities and work within the framework of a national curriculum designed by the parliament and government.
But, while everyone must follow these rules, individual schools are run in a competitive manner.
Anyone – parents, teachers, or even companies – can apply for a license to operate a school.
The National School Board is, in principle, instructed to approve an application if the proposed school is likely to fulfill the national goals and has a solid financial base.
Moreover, private schools are not seen as mere supplements to public schools, but as fully-fledged alternatives, so they need not offer something different.
A community where a private school offers its services must support it with the same amount of money, or vouchers, per student that it provides to public schools.
The amount of financing per student is the same, and schools that receive vouchers cannot charge additional fees.
After this system was adopted in the 1990’s, many non-public schools were established.
The pioneers were often parents’ or teachers’ cooperatives, usually with a special pedagogical philosophy.
Companies operating chains of schools later came to play an important role as well.
As a result, the variety of schools has increased throughout Sweden.
The voucher system means that all students, irrespective of family income, can attend the school of their choice.
Even in rural areas, there is now a wide choice of schools, and it seems that competition has improved the overall quality of Swedish schools, as non-public schools’ very existence has created a demand for reform of public schools.
If there is any difference, it seems that non-public schools often are better than public schools in dealing with children with learning problems.
There are, of course many alternatives to what Sweden has done to revitalize education.
But three features of Sweden’s reform seem particularly important: it was based on a combination of public and market systems; it was general in form, without demanding that non-public schools be special in order to be licensed; and it covered all students.
Sweden’s voucher educational system is probably the most ambitions of its kind in the world.
This is all the more remarkable insofar as the principle of competition on which it relies has taken root in a country where competition within the area of public services has not generally been accepted.
Twenty years ago, a grass-roots movement led by Rotary International, a voluntary organization with around 1.2 million members in more than 200 countries, decided to attack.
As of the mid-1980’s, there were more than 300,000 cases of polio per year worldwide, despite the disease’s virtual elimination in the richest countries, where vaccination was routine.
Rotary took on the challenge of getting vaccines to the poor, in regions with weak or non-existent public health systems.
Rotarians dreamed not only of reducing the number of polio cases, but of eradicating the disease entirely.
This goal is now within reach.
Rather than wait for politicians to take up the fight against polio, Rotarians led the way.
A few years later, the World Health Organization, and then other international agencies and donor countries, joined the cause, creating a coalition of official and private organizations that now support Rotary’s vision.
By 2006, the number of polio cases had been cut dramatically, to well under 3,000 cases per year.
Complete eradication is in reach, but is still proving elusive, as small outbreaks have plagued one country or another in recent years.
In some cases, such as Northern Nigeria, social resistance to the vaccine has blocked adequate coverage of the population.
Pockets of polio transmission also persist in India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
In a few other countries, the disease has been sporadically reintroduced by travelers from regions where polio has not yet been eliminated.
And, in rare cases, the vaccine itself has failed and led to infection.
Still, despite the difficulties of rooting out the very last cases, the progress made against polio has been historic.
More importantly, Rotary’s leadership on polio offers a more general lesson in the fight against extreme poverty, hunger, and disease.
Even when politicians don’t lead, it is still possible for committed individuals and voluntary organizations to change the world.
The key is to link a bold idea with a practical and powerful technology, and then to push the idea and technology forward through mass citizen action.
These same lessons can be applied to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s), the targets for fighting poverty, disease, and hunger that the world’s governments adopted in 2000.
The MDG’s are bold but achievable.
For example, they call for reducing by 2015 the proportion of the world’s population that was chronically under-nourished in 1990, and for cutting the child mortality rate by three quarters.
The MDG’s also address the scourges of maternal death in childbirth, lack of access to safe drinking water, and killer diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS.
Just as with polio, the fight against hunger, disease, and lack of access to safe water and sanitation can be carried forward with practical and powerful technologies.
Indeed, these technologies are so powerful that they can enable families currently trapped in poverty to escape it once and for all.
Consider hunger in Africa.
Most of Africa’s farmers, working tiny plots, do not produce enough food to feed their families, much less to earn an income.
The root of the problem is that Africa’s farmers are too poor to obtain the basic modern inputs—including high-yield seed varieties, fertilizers, and small-scale water management systems—that could enable them to double or triple their output of food and cash crops.
The solution is therefore not much more complicated than a polio vaccine.
If organizations like Rotary International can help African farmers to get a 50 kilogram bag of appropriate fertilizer and a 10 kilogram tin of improved seeds, the rise in farm output could be enough to relieve extreme hunger and help farm households begin to earn some income.
Such practical approaches can solve many of the key problems of extreme poverty.
Consider, similarly, the death and illness caused by malaria, which can be reduced very sharply through the use of mosquito nets for beds and anti-malaria medicines.
An anti-malaria bed net costs just $5, lasts five years, and can accommodate two children.
Thus, for just $0.50 per year, each child can be protected by a bed net.
And a $1 medical treatment can cure malaria if the child gets infected despite the bed net.
Yet bed nets and anti-malaria medicines do not reach the people who need them, because the people who need them are too poor.
Fortunately, the American Red Cross and other organizations have been following the Rotary model, using private donations and private volunteers to fill the gap left by our political leaders.
Red Cross chapters across Africa, in partnership with other organizations, are now distributing bed nets free of charge to impoverished families, in the same way that Rotary has been distributing polio vaccines.
The time has arrived for a massive effort by voluntary organizations to take up the MDG’s through private action.
We need not wait for the politicians.
In a short period of time, the world’s citizens can make deep inroads in the fight against disease, hunger, and poverty.
Then the politicians will follow.
The key is practicality, boldness, and, most importantly, a commitment by those who are better off to volunteer their time and money to bring practical help–in the form of high-yield seeds, fertilizers, medicines, bed nets, drinking wells, and materials to build school rooms and clinics—to the world’s poorest people.
MOSCOW – The challenges facing civil-society organizations are greater in Russia than in many parts of the world, but the challenges facing civil society itself are similar everywhere.
Indeed, around the world there is a gap between civil-society organizations and the societies they profess to serve.
Civil-society organizations do not gain power through elections (legitimate or otherwise), but through reaching the broader world.
In short, their goal is to build civil society itself. 
They are most successful when people behave as part of civil society without necessarily being “civil-society” professionals.
That is, they will do such things as take care of their own health, engage in public discussions or blog about safety conditions in their community, rate school performance, organize weekly runs for dog owners, care for their local forests or rivers- as part of their lives, not as part of their jobs.
One area of concern for civil society nowadays is the press and new media.
In many places today information is flowing more than ever, but mass media are under both political and financial pressure. 
Most people think of a free press as a way to keep track of what governments are doing – and so it is.
That is why the press as a whole, and journalists in particular, are so frequently targeted by the authorities.
When media outlets aren’t owned – and tamed – by the authorities or people close to them, they still face censorship, intimidation, tax audits, and occasionally assassination of their journalists and editors.
In Russia in particular, the situation is mixed.
The government owns or controls most of the mass media – the major newspapers and television stations – but there is an abundance of mostly marginalized publications and radio stations (to say nothing of the Internet) that retain a remarkable degree of independence.
They are not directly censored, but they operate under the chilling knowledge that they can be shut down on vague charges at any moment.
And, of course, most of them are struggling to survive financially.
Yet there’s more to journalism than keeping an eye on the government.
Journalism’s other task is to reflect a society back to itself – to spread an accurate picture of its current situation, to share information about the activities of private citizens and businesses as they build civil society, and to encourage citizens to become active in improving their own lives and developing their communities.
Consider health care.
As far as I’m concerned, the ultimate goal should be not so much a better health care system, but a population so healthy that it hardly needs health care.
Health problems may take you to a clinic, but many of them start with how you behave at home – what you eat and drink, whether you smoke or exercise or sleep enough, etc.
This is the kind of thinking that was driving us at a recent health care working group gathered as part of the recent Civil Society Summit organized in Moscow by the Eurasia Foundation, the New Eurasia Foundation and the CSIS.  (I was there as a Eurasia Foundation board member.)
To tackle these problems, we came up with an “open data/information liquidity” project, which will advocate and organize the publication, exchange, aggregation, and analysis of health data – not just general statistics, but specific data about health outcomes in terms of drugs and treatments, hospital performance, and the like.
Of course, many of those statistics are not even collected, yet alone published.
But we can start with what exists, and by so doing create demand for the rest.
In the United States, people are already rating their own doctors at sites such as RateMDs.com and vitals.com; third-party doctor and hospital ratings are available at HealthGrades.com.
Civil-society groups don’t often run hospitals directly, but they can make their performance more transparent.
So there are plans afoot to develop and distribute tools to analyze information, discover correlations (data-mining), and display the results as graphs and charts.
But, again, health really begins at home, so the real victory – and one where such civil-society cooperation may have a more immediate impact – is to give people better data about themselves and what they should be doing for their own health.
That includes everything from nutritional information and baby care, to (ultimately) records of each person’s own health and treatments, and it starts with using new media to reach people where they live, with content that’s relevant.  In the Soviet Union, they used to call this “sanitary propaganda,” but it was widely disregarded.
One Russian friend told me, “Whenever we would read an article about the health dangers of butter, we would immediately run out and buy as much butter as we could find, because we knew it meant there would be a butter shortage.”
Today, that type of information is called “healthy lifestyle promotion.”
We are also working on a project along these lines, reaching out to target populations with two-way new media such as the Internet and mobile phones, rather than harangues in newspapers and TV.
Imagine a program where pregnant women could sign up by cell phone for weekly reminders and updates, and to answer questions such as, “Is the baby kicking?” If not, she could be referred to a local clinic.
When I made those same points in a wrap-up to the Civil Society Summit as a whole, I was interrupted by none other than US president Barack Obama, who was in Moscow for his summit with President Dmitry Medvedev but also took the time to listen our gathering of civil-society organizations.
Obama apologized for arriving late, and added: “That’s why we have civil society.
You just can’t rely on politicians!”
PARIS – What does it mean to be “civilized”?
Obviously, being highly educated, wearing a tie, eating with a fork, or cutting one’s nails weekly is not enough.
We all know that being “civilized” in this formal way doesn’t prevent people from behaving like barbarians.
Everywhere and at all times, being civilized means being able to recognize and accept the humanity of others, despite their different modes of living.
That may seem like an obvious point, but it is not universally accepted.
The idea of dialogue between civilizations usually gets a good press, but it is also sometimes mocked.
The conclusion of Elie Barnavi’s recent essay Les religions meurtrières (“Murderous religions”) is entitled “Against the dialogue of civilizations.” His argument is implacable: “There is civilization on one hand and barbarism on the other.
There is no possible dialogue between them.”
But if you look at this line of argument more closely, the flaw in Barnavi’s argument is immediately apparent.
The meaning of the words civilization and culture is very different when they are used in singular and plural forms. Cultures (plural) are the modes of living embraced by various human groups, and comprise all that their members have in common: language, religion, family structures, diet, dress, and so on.
In this sense, “culture” is a descriptive category, without any value judgment.
Civilization (singular) is, on the contrary, an evaluative moral category: the opposite of barbarism.
So a dialogue between cultures is not only beneficial, but essential to civilization.
No civilization is possible without it.
Contrary to what proponents of the idea of a “clash of civilizations” claim, encounters between different cultures usually take place easily and peacefully, because we are psychologically prepared for them.
Everyone is the product of several cultures, even if one has never left his home country, because culture is not only national.
All of us carry within us the culture of our sex, age group, wealth, class, and job.
This plurality of cultures usually does not present any problems for us, because shifting from one cultural code to another is a universal human faculty.
After all, we don’t talk in the same way to every person we meet during the day.
Moreover, cultures related to a given territory are never really “pure”.
As far back as you can go in the history of a country like France, you will find meetings between different tribes and ethnic groups, and thus different cultures: Gallics, Franks, Romans, and many others.
Everywhere we look (except, perhaps, in New Guinea’s deep valleys, where obscure tribes may remain isolated from one another), there are only mixed cultures.
But, while some cultures are proud of their plurality, others try to hide it.
The concept of a dialogue between cultures is sometimes strained, or seems only a pious hope, because we ask it to do the impossible: solve inflamed political conflicts.
Dialogue, as benevolent as it may be, can’t resolve questions related to people’s freedom of movement, or to the sharing of territory or natural resources.
Politics and culture don’t work on the same level: the former governs action, the latter influences mentalities; the former deals with emergencies, the latter can require generations to produce any result.
We should work for this type of dialogue by beginning with simple and modest initiatives.
We need more translations of the ideas and literatures of other countries, more long stays abroad for university students, more teaching of foreign languages and encouragement of study about other cultures, and more confrontation between national memories (say, between France and Algeria).
Some measures of this type already exist in the European Union, but they should be introduced elsewhere: North Africa, the Middle East, India, China, Japan, and Latin America.
The best way to initiate a dialogue is to disregard clichés and generalities, and instead to promote gatherings between human beings.
For the moment, politics has claimed paramount status.
Yet, from another point of view, dialogue prevails over war and the stubborn defense of what one believes to be his identity, because it brings us closer to the vocation of humanity.
The novelist André Schwarz-Bart used to tell this story: A chief rabbi was once asked why the stork, which is called Hassada (affectionate) in Hebrew because it loves its own kind, is classified among unclean animals. “Because,” the rabbi replied, “it gives its love only to its own kind.”
PRINCETON – Diamonds have an image of purity and light.
They are given as a pledge of love and worn as a symbol of commitment.
Yet diamonds have led to gruesome murders, as well as widespread rapes and amputations.
Charles Taylor, a former president of Liberia currently facing war crimes charges at a special court in The Hague, is alleged to have used diamonds to fund rebels in Sierra Leone’s civil war.  The case against Taylor represents only one of several examples in which diamonds have facilitated widespread human rights violations.
When diamonds’ role in fueling violent conflict in Africa gained worldwide attention, the diamond industry established the Kimberley Process in order to keep “blood diamonds” out of international trade.
The initiative has met with some success, although it has not completely halted trade in diamonds from conflict-torn countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Recently, however, concern has been expressed – from within the diamond trade – that the scope of the Kimberley Process is too limited, and that consumers have thus been lulled into believing that there are no longer any ethical problems with diamonds.
That is far from the truth.
The problem came to a head this year when the Kimberley Process began to certify diamonds from Marange, in Zimbabwe.
The Marange diamond field, discovered in 2006, is one of the richest ever found.
According to Diamonds and Clubs, a recent report from Partnership Africa Canada, soldiers have press-ganged peasant farmers into working in mining syndicates at Marange. The soldiers then take half the proceeds.
There have also been extensive beatings and arbitrary detentions.
When Farai Maguwu, a Zimbabwean human rights activist, disseminated information about the abuses, he was arrested (he has since been released).
Zimbabwean authorities claim that the violent human rights abuses have stopped, but the ethical problem with Marange diamonds goes much deeper.
Soon after the field was discovered, the Zimbabwean military took control of the area.
According to the Zimbabwean finance minister, Tendai Biti, four years after the military took over the diamond fields, the national treasury has received not one penny of royalties from the sale of Marange diamonds.
Zimbabwe’s military and political elite has appropriated the diamond field’s immense wealth for itself, with no benefits for the millions of desperately poor Zimbabweans who need the kind of services that the country has the resources to provide.
This is not, of course, the first time that the discovery of resources in an undeveloped country has led to riches for a few rather than greater prosperity for all.
Teodoro Obiang, the dictator of tiny, oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, has an official salary of $60,000, but owns six private jets and a $35 million house in Malibu, as well as other houses in Maryland and Capetown and a fleet of Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and Bentleys.
Most of the people over whom Obiang rules live in extreme poverty, with an average life expectancy of 49 years and an infant mortality rate of 87 per 1,000 live births (in other words, more than one child in twelve dies before its first birthday).
Nigeria and Angola are other glaring examples of countries that have failed to use their oil wealth for the benefit of their people.
Paradoxically, resource-rich developing countries are often worse off than comparable countries that lack those resources.
One reason for this is that large resource endowments provide a huge financial incentive for attempts to overthrow the government and seize power.
Rebels know that if they succeed, they will gain immense personal wealth, be able to reward those who backed their coup, and have enough arms to keep themselves in power, no matter how badly they rule.
Unless, of course, some of those whom they arm are themselves tempted by the prospect of controlling all that wealth.
Thus, the resources that should benefit developing countries instead become a curse that brings corruption, coups, and civil wars.
If we use goods made from raw materials that are obtained from a poor country without the proceeds being used to benefit the people of that country, we become complicit in a particularly iniquitous form of grand larceny.
It is therefore encouraging that concerns about Zimbabwean diamonds are being raised within the diamond trade itself.
The Rapaport Group, an international network of companies providing services to the diamond industry, refuses to list Marange diamonds on its diamond-trading platform, RapNet.
Martin Rapaport, chairman of the group, has called for free access to the diamond fields by non-governmental organizations and industry representatives to monitor the human rights situation. More significantly, in a speech in Mumbai earlier this year, he laid out requirements for legitimizing Marange diamonds that included some assurance that “the revenues from the diamond sales are distributed legally and in a way that reasonably and fairly benefits the people of Zimbabwe.”
There is a need for higher standards than those set by the Kimberley Process.
If consumers insist on buying only ethical diamonds, traders might be able to push the demand back to their sources.
And, if the diamond industry can put itself on an ethical footing, it might send a message to other industries that deal in resources that are effectively being stolen from some of the world’s poorest people.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised that the G-8 meeting on July 6-8 at Gleneagles, Scotland, which he will chair, will focus on two of the most important and longstanding global problems—Third-World poverty and global warming.
For a long time, these two issues seemed to be at odds.
The developing world understandably does not want to sacrifice its growth for a global public good, especially when the United States, the richest country in the world, seems unwilling to sacrifice even a little of its luxurious life style.
Led by Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, a group of developing countries, a new rainforest coalition has now come forward with an innovative proposal, not only offering to commit to greenhouse-gas limits, but also showing how this can be done in a way that will promote their development.
Developing countries have long provided a vital global public good: maintaining global environmental assets.
Their rainforests are a vast storehouse of biodiversity, and forests are major carbon sinks, reducing the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.
I served on the International Panel for Climate Change in the mid-1990’s, reviewing the scientific evidence concerning the magnitude of increases in greenhouse gasses and their economic and social consequences.
At the time, there was already overwhelming evidence of a serious problem that needed to be addressed, and data since then ­­– concerning, for example, the rapid melting of the polar ice cap – have strongly reinforced this conclusion.
About a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions are from land-use change, mainly deforestation, an amount comparable to US emissions from burning fossil fuels (the US is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.)
By maintaining their rainforests, tropical countries provide an invaluable global service, one for which they have so far failed to be compensated.
But, especially after the signing of the Kyoto protocol, we can value at least part of these environmental services: carbon sequestration (that is, if they did not maintain their forests, the level of carbon concentrations in the atmosphere would be enormously higher).
The Kyoto Protocol has generated new markets for trading carbon emissions, such as the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).
At current carbon prices, the value of carbon sequestration by tropical rainforests likely equals or exceeds the current level of international aid being provided to developing countries.
In effect, the poor are aiding the rich.
Biodiversity and climatic stability are global public goods.
The benefits of conservation to the world as a whole far exceed the value of exploitation to a country like Papua New Guinea (PNG).
The PNG government would like to do the right thing, to maintain its natural capital for future generations.
But officials there believe that that they have currently no choice.
A huge mistake was made (for a variety of reasons) at Kyoto.
While countries can be compensated for planting forests, they cannot be compensated for avoiding deforestation.
Countries like PNG would thus be doubly better off if they cut down their ancient hardwood trees and replanted.
But this makes no sense economically or socially.
These countries should be given incentives to maintain their forests.
(There are, as always, technical issues to be resolved, concerning monitoring and measurement, but these can be overcome easily with modern technologies.)
At the very least, markets like ETS should credit emissions reductions that result from limiting deforestation.
Without such a program, unfortunately, developing countries have neither the means nor incentives to underwrite conservation.
There are some 2.7 billion people in over 60 developing countries that are home to the world’s tropical forests.
Cutting down the hardwood forests – even when they presently receive just 5% of the final price in, say, New York – is the only way people can make ends meet.
Some have suggested waiting to address this issue until 2012, when a revised protocol is supposed to come into effect.
But, can we wait?
At currents rates of deforestation, the combined contributions to greenhouse gas concentrations from Brazil and Indonesia alone would offset nearly 80% of the emission reductions gained from the Kyoto protocol.
What is so impressive about the new rainforest initiative is that it comes from the developing countries themselves; it represents their creativity and social commitment.
For the first time, developing countries seem willing to undertake the kinds of commitments that Europe, Japan, and the other advanced industrial countries (except the US) have made to avoid what could be a global disaster.
Costa Rica, for example, has already shown that a system of paying for the provision of environmental services (like maintaining natural forests) can work in ways that preserve the environment and boost the economy.
Compensating the developing countries for providing these environmental services would be one way of substantially increasing aid – and at the same time, providing these countries with the right market incentives.
From a global point of view, the best use of these resources is to maintain the forests, which is even possible with managed cutting.
This is an initiative around which all countries can and should rally.
In a world divided – between rich countries and the poor, between those focusing on environmental protection and those concentrating on growth – this initiative can unite us all.
The G-8 leaders should heed the call.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently released alarming data on the consequences of global warming in some of the world’s poorest regions.
By 2100, one billion to three billion people worldwide are expected to suffer from water scarcity.
Global warming will increase evaporation and severely reduce rainfalls – by up to 20% in the Middle East and North Africa – with the amount of water available per person possibly halved by mid-century in these regions.
This sudden scarcity of an element whose symbolic and spiritual importance matches its centrality to human life will cause stress and exacerbate conflicts worldwide.
Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia will be the first to be exposed.
The repercussions, however, will be global.
Yet this bleak picture is neither an excuse for apathy nor grounds for pessimism.
Conflicts may be inevitable; wars are not.
Our ability to prevent “water wars” will depend on our collective capacity to anticipate tensions, and to find the technical and institutional solutions to manage emerging conflicts.
The good news is that such solutions exist, and are proving their efficacy everyday.
Dams – provided they are adequately sized and designed – can contribute to human development by fighting climate change and regulating water supply.
Yet in a new context of scarcity, upstream infrastructure projects on international rivers may impact water quality or availability for neighboring states, thus causing tensions.
River basin organizations such as that established for the Nile, Niger, or Senegal rivers help facilitate dialogue between states that share hydraulic resources.
By developing a joint vision for the development of international waterways, these regional cooperation initiatives work towards common ownership of the resource, thereby reducing the risk that disputes over water use will escalate into violence.
Most international waterways have such frameworks for dialogue, albeit at different stages of development and levels of achievement.
If we are to take climate change predictions seriously, the international community should strengthen these initiatives.
Where they do not exist, they should be created in partnership with all the countries concerned.
Official development assistance can create incentives to cooperate by financing data-collection, providing technical know-how, or, indeed, by conditioning loans on constructive negotiations.
Yet international water conflicts are only one side of the coin.
The most violent water wars take place today within rather than among states.
A dearth of water fuels ethnic strife, as communities begin to fear for their survival and seek to capture the resource.
In Darfur, recurrent drought has poisoned relations between farmers and nomadic herdsmen, and the war we are helplessly witnessing today follows years of escalating conflict.
Chad risks falling prey to the same cycle of violence.
It is thus urgent to satisfy populations’ most basic human needs through local development initiatives.
Rural hydraulic projects, which ensure access to water for these populations over large stretches of land, can prove to be efficient conflict prevention tools.
Secured grazing corridors are being established with the help of modern satellite imagery to orient nomads and their herds to appropriate areas.
Such initiatives provide rare opportunities for dialogue and collaboration between rival communities.
The key is to anticipate the need for action before tensions escalate to the point of no return.
Water consumption also must be addressed.
Agriculture accounts for more than 70% of water use in the world.
Agronomical research and technical innovations are crucial to maximizing water efficiency in this sector, and they must be taken much further.
But addressing scarcity will inevitably imply revising agricultural practices and policies worldwide to ensure their sustainability.
The development challenge no longer solely consists in bringing agricultural water to deprived areas.
As the dramatic shrinkage of the Aral Sea, Lake Chad, and the Dead Sea illustrate, it now requires preserving scarce natural resources and ensuring their equitable distribution among conflicting needs.
Responsible use will require adequate economic incentives.
In West Africa or the Middle East, Central Asia or India, this, too, can contribute to abating clashes over water.
Given the unprecedented scale of the threat, business as usual is not an option.
The Cold War came to a peaceful end thanks to realism, foresight, and strength of will.
These three qualities should be put to work if our planet is to be spared major water wars.
This global challenge also demands innovation in global governance, which is why we support the creation of a UN Environment Agency, endowed with the legal and financial resources needed to tackle the issues at hand.
Humanity must begin to resolve this water dilemma.
Waiting is not part of the solution.
COPENHAGEN – One of the stranger spectacles of the climate change debate was the sight, earlier this month, of NASA climate scientist Jim Hansen marching hand-in-hand with Hollywood actress Darryl Hannah outside the Capitol Coal Power Plant in Washington, DC.
Hansen promised to brave arrest at what was billed as the world’s largest direct-action climate change protest.
Instead, the worst snowstorm in three years reduced the size of the crowd, prevented special guests from arriving, and hindered efforts to use a solar panel to light up a protest billboard.
The police reportedly told the crowd that they didn’t want to arrest anybody who didn’t want to be arrested, and nobody was.
That didn’t stop the protesters from proclaiming the event a success. “VICTORY: THIS IS HOW TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING,” declared the Web site of Capitol Climate Action.
And, indeed, the US House Speaker and Senate Majority Leader called on the Architect of the Capitol to stop using coal for the Capitol Power Plant (albeit days before the rally).
But if stopping global warming were this easy, I – and everybody I know – would be painting placards for the next round of direct action.
Hansen condemns coal-fired power plants as “death factories,” and his belief that coal is evil is widely shared.
It is also obviously wrong.
If we were to stop using coal tomorrow, we would discover that it remains a vital source of life.
Coal accounts for almost half of the planet’s electricity supply, including half the power consumed in the United States.
Coal keeps hospitals and core infrastructure running, provides warmth and light in winter, and makes life-saving air conditioning available in summer.
In China and India, where coal accounts for about 80% of power generation, it has helped to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
It is little wonder, then, that US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who two years ago described the expansion of coal-fired power plants as his “worst nightmare,” now calls coal a “great natural resource.”
The vital question is what would replace coal if were to stop using it.
Judging from their chant – “No coal, no gas, no nukes, no kidding” and “Biofuels - hell no!” – the protesters in Washington would rule out many plausible alternatives.
Solar and wind power appear to be acceptable, but both are much less reliable than coal, and much more expensive.
Only about 0.5% of the world’s energy comes from these renewable sources.
Even with optimistic assumptions, the International Energy Agency estimates that their share will rise to just 2.8% by 2030.
One reason is that we don’t know how to store the energy from these sources: when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, what powers your computer or the hospital’s operating room?
Moreover, renewables are still costly.
Recently, former US Vice President Al Gore and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon claimed that, “in the US, there are now more jobs in the wind industry than in the entire coal industry.”
Never mind that the numbers were massaged, because they still hold a valuable lesson.
The US gets 50% of its electricity from coal but less than 0.5% from wind.
If it takes about the same manpower to produce both, wind power is phenomenally more expensive.   
The equivalent of more than 60 million barrels of oil is consumed in coal every day, and there is no affordable “green” alternative.
There is an ample and cheap supply of coal for several centuries.
We need to accept that much of the world’s cheap coal will be burned – but we should focus on capturing the CO2.
In agreements announced by the Obama administration, the US is working with China and Canada on projects to develop this technology.
The end of fossil fuel’s stronghold will come when we have cheap alternatives, especially in developing countries.
That day will arrive sooner if governments spend a lot more money on low-carbon energy research, which is woefully inadequate.
Every nation should ideally commit to spending 0.05% of GDP exploring non-carbon-emitting energy technologies.
This would cost $25 billion per year – a 10-fold increase in global financing – and create momentum to recapture the vision of delivering a low-carbon, high-income world.
Coal contributes strongly to global warming, but no amount of political theater can alter the inescapable fact that it also provides benefits that we cannot yet replicate with renewable energy.
Braving arrest with Hollywood stars is a diversion.
Declaring true victory over global warming will take a lot more pragmatism, and a lot more work.
NEW YORK – “Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen,” a popular song from the 1952 film musical “Hans Christian Andersen,” will probably be played many times this fall, as world leaders will be gathering in the Danish capital in December (and in New York in September) to confront the challenge of climate change.
But, unless international thinking gets considerably more realistic in a hurry, what happens in Copenhagen will be anything but wonderful.
It should come as no surprise that there is little consensus on a comprehensive accord that would have a meaningful impact on the world’s climate.
Governments will not sacrifice near- and medium-term economic growth for long-term environmental benefits.
This is especially true now, given that much of the developed world is in the midst of a painful recession.
The United States, for one, will not accept ceilings that reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions significantly if it means accepting higher costs and taxes that risk slowing economic recovery.
Developing countries are, if anything, even more opposed to such ceilings or “caps.”
Four hundred million Indians still lack electricity; India cannot be expected to rule out greater use of coal if that proves to be the best way to produce electricity for one-third of its citizens.
China, too, is unlikely to agree to “caps” on emissions of any kind, given the relatively low standard of living of most Chinese.
But such a stance dooms prospects for a new global treaty, as developed countries will rightly insist that poorer countries be part of the solution.
The consequences of failure in Copenhagen could be considerable.
In the short run, we may well see climate-related concerns become the newest excuse for increased trade protectionism.
So-called “carbon tariffs” are likely to be introduced to penalize imports from countries or companies deemed not to be doing enough to curb emissions.
World trade is already down sharply as a result of the economic crisis; introducing new tariffs would inevitably reduce trade further, causing the loss of additional jobs and leading to new frictions.
Over time, a failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would lead to additional climate change, which in turn would increase the severity of poverty, the scale of internal displacement and migration, the scarcity of water, the prevalence of disease, and the number and intensity of storms.
The result could be more failed states and more conflict between states.
Climate change is as much a matter of security as it is an economic and human concern.
So what should be done?
The most important step for those preparing for Copenhagen is to embrace national policies that increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
The US has at long last done some of this in adopting new and much higher standards for automobile fuel efficiency.
Regulatory policy can increase the efficiency of appliances, housing, and machinery.
Such reforms should appeal to rich and poor countries alike, as they would reduce spending on energy and dependence on oil imports.
Coordinated national actions are not the same as unilateralism.
There is no unilateral answer to what is a global challenge.
But to describe a challenge as global is not to argue that the remedy is to be found only in an ambitious, formal, and universal treaty.
Such an accord might well be desirable, but it is simply not an option for climate change any time soon.
The goal for the representatives of the nearly 200 countries who will meet in Copenhagen should not be a single sweeping agreement so much as a set of more modest agreements.
Coal is one place to begin, as it will continue to generate the lion’s share of the world’s electricity for decades to come.
Greater sharing of existing cleaner-coal technologies is needed, as is continued development of next-generation clean-coal plants.
Nuclear power is another area requiring attention. So, too, are renewable forms of power, such as solar and wind.
Here, too, mechanisms are needed for sharing new technologies and helping poorer countries pay for them in exchange for adopting policies that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
Moreover, stopping the destruction of forests is essential, given how much carbon is trapped in them.
One objective for Copenhagen should be to create a well-endowed global fund to support policies that discourage the cutting and burning of trees, help countries such as Brazil and Indonesia protect their rain forests, and provide alternative livelihoods to those who currently benefit from destroying them.
Focusing on steps such as these would go a long way toward attaining the often-discussed goal of halving global carbon emissions by mid-century.
But reaching an accord that sets binding ceilings for what each country will be allowed to emit is not an option in Copenhagen.
The consensus simply does not exist.
Smaller steps, however, can and should be taken.
Those who want to master the challenge of climate change now will reject such realism.
But, as is often the case, those who insist on getting everything risk getting nothing.            
You would have had to be stuck in deepest Mongolia to avoid hearing that the United Nations’ climate panel, the IPCC, issued a new report last week.
Perhaps even in the depths of Mongolia, you would have heard the dire warnings emitted by journalists.
You would have distilled from these agonized noises that the report concluded that global warming is worse than we had imagined, and that we need to take swift and strong action right now.
You would have been misinformed.
The IPCC has produced a good report – an attempt to summarize what the world’s scientists know about global warming.
Unlike the Bush administration, caught downplaying the science, the IPCC squarely tells us that mankind is largely responsible for the planet’s recent warming.
And, unlike Al Gore, who has travelled the world warning that our cities might soon be under the oceans, it refrains from scaremongering.
But lost among the hype is the unexciting fact that this report is actually no more dire than the IPCC’s last report, issued in 2001.
In two important ways, this year’s effort was actually less dire.
The report reflected the fact that since 2001, scientists have become more certain that humans are responsible for a large part of global warming.
Otherwise, though, this report had a definite sense of déjà vu .
Estimates of temperature increases, heat waves, and cold waves are all nearly identical to those produced six years ago.
The report did, however, contain two surprising facts.
Both went unmentioned in most reports.
First, the world’s scientists have re-jigged their estimates about how much sea levels will rise.
In the 1980’s, America’s Environmental Protection Agency expected oceans to rise by several metres by 2100.
By the 1990’s, the IPCC was expecting a 67-centimeter rise.
Six years ago, it anticipated ocean levels would be 48.5 centimeters higher than they are currently.
In this year’s report, the estimated rise is 38.5 centimeters on average.
This is especially interesting since it fundamentally rejects one of the most harrowing scenes from Al Gore’s movie An Inconvenient Truth .
In graphic detail, Gore demonstrated how a 20-foot rise in the sea level would inundate much of Florida, Shanghai, and Holland.
The IPCC report makes it clear that exaggerations of this magnitude have no basis in science – though clearly they frightened people and perhaps will win Gore an Academy Award.
The report also revealed the improbability of another Gore scenario: that global warming could make the Gulf Stream shut down, turning Europe into a new Siberia.
The IPCC simply and tersely tells us that this scenario – also vividly depicted in the Hollywood movie The Day After Tomorrow – is considered “very unlikely.”
Moreover, even if the Gulf Stream were to weaken over the century, this would be good , as there would be less net warming over land areas.
So why have we been left with a very different impression of the climate panel’s report?
The IPCC is by statute “politically neutral” – it is supposed to tell us just the facts and leave the rest to politicians and the people who elect them.
This is why the report is a careful and sensible document.
But scientists and journalists – acting as intermediaries between the report and the public – have engaged in greenhouse activism.
Elsewhere calling for immediate and substantial cuts in carbon emissions, the IPCC’s director even declared that he hoped the IPCC report would “shock people, governments into taking more serious action.”
It is inappropriate for somebody in such an important and apolitical role to engage in blatant activism.
Imagine if the director of the CIA published a new assessment of Iran, saying “I hope this report will shock people, governments into taking more serious action.”
Climate change is a real and serious problem.
But the problem with the recent media frenzy is that some seem to believe no new report or development is enough if it doesn’t reveal more serious consequences and more terrifying calamities than humanity has ever considered before.
Indeed, this media frenzy has little or no scientific backing.
One of England’s foremost climatologists, Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, points out that green militancy and megaphone journalism use “catastrophe and chaos as unguided weapons with which forlornly to threaten society into behavioral change.” In his words, “we need to take a deep breath and pause.”
A 38.5 cm rise in the ocean’s levels is a problem, but by no means will it bring down civilization.
Last century sea levels rose by half that amount without most of us even noticing.
The UN tells us that there is virtually nothing we can do that would affect climate change before 2030.
So we have to ask the hard question of whether we could do better by focusing on other issues first – helping real people improve their lives and resilience so they can better deal with the world’s challenges.
When Nobel Laureate economists weighed up how to achieve the most good for the world in a recent project called the Copenhagen Consensus, they found that focusing on HIV/AIDS, malaria, malnutrition, and trade barriers should all be tackled long before we commit to any dramatic action on climate change.
With the world in a fury about cutting greenhouse gasses, it is easy to forget that there are other and better ways to do some good for the planet.
Good decisions come from careful consideration.
The IPCC report provides that.
But the cacophony of screaming that has accompanied it does not help.
DURBAN – Before the Copenhagen climate-change summit two years ago, the two of us sat together in Cape Town to listen to five African farmers from different countries, four of whom were women, tell us how climate change was undermining their livelihoods.
Each explained how floods and drought, and the lack of regular seasons to sow and reap, were outside their normal experience.
Their fears are shared by subsistence farmers and indigenous people worldwide – the people bearing the brunt of climate shocks, though they played no part in causing them.
Now, two years later, we are in Durban, where South Africa is hosting this year’s climate-change conference, COP17, and the situation for poor people in Africa and elsewhere has deteriorated even further.
In its latest report, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that it is virtually certain that, in global terms, hot days have become hotter and occur more often; indeed, they have increased in frequency by a factor of 10 in most regions of the world.
Moreover, the brutal paradox of climate change is that heavy precipitation is occurring more often as well, increasing the risk of flooding.
Since 2003, East Africa has had the eight warmest years on record, which is no doubt contributing to the severe famine that now afflicts 13 million people in the Horn of Africa.
These are the consequences that a mere one degree of warming above pre-industrial levels has wrought.
The UN Environment Program’s just published report Bridging the Emissions Gap shows that over the course of this century, warming will likely rise to four degrees unless we take stronger action to cut emissions.
Yet the latest evidence demonstrates that we are not acting – the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Report 2011 reveals that CO2 emissions have rebounded to a record high.
We are alarmed that expectations for COP17 are so low.
Where is the global leadership that must respond urgently?
We desperately need a global deal.
At the heart of this deal is the preservation of the Kyoto Protocol.
The Protocol is not a perfect instrument.
It does too little to cut global emissions, and it requires too few countries to cut their emissions growth.
But it is part of international law, and that is vital.&#160;
Climate change is a global problem: if countries are not confident that others are addressing it, they will not feel an imperative to act themselves.
So, having a legal framework with clear and common rules to which all countries are committed is critically important – and the only assurance we have that action will be taken to protect the most vulnerable.
The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012.
So the European Union and the other Kyoto parties (the United States never ratified the agreement, and the Protocol’s terms asked little of China, India, and other emerging powers) must commit to a second commitment period, in order to ensure that this legal framework is maintained.
At the same time, all countries must acknowledge that extending the lifespan of the Kyoto Protocol will not solve the problem of climate change, and that a new or additional legal framework that covers all countries is needed.
The Durban meeting must agree to initiate negotiations towards this end – with a view to concluding a new legal instrument by 2015 at the latest.
All of this is not only possible, but also necessary, because the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy makes economic, social, and environmental sense.
The problem is that making it happen requires political will, which, unfortunately, seems in short supply.
Climate change is a matter of justice.
The richest countries caused the problem, but it is the world’s poorest who are already suffering from its effects.
In Durban, the international community must commit to righting that wrong.
Political leaders must think inter-generationally.
They need to imagine the world of 2050, with its nine billion people, and take the right decisions now to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a liveable world.
COPENHAGEN – As George W. Bush and Tony Blair learned the hard way, the public does not take kindly to being misled about the nature of potential threats.
The after-the-fact revelation that the reasons for invading Iraq were vastly exaggerated – and in some cases completely fabricated – produced an angry backlash that helped toss the Republicans out of power in the United States in 2008 and may do the same to Britain’s Labour Party later this year.
A similar shift in global public opinion is occurring with respect to climate change.
The process picked up momentum late last year, after hackers leaked thousands of e-mails from a top British research facility showing that some of the world’s most influential climatologists had been trying to disguise flaws in their work, blocking scrutiny, and plotting together to enforce what amounts to a party line on climate change.
More recently, the United Nations’ respected advisory group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has been deeply embarrassed by the revelation that some alarming predictions contained in an influential report that it released in 2007 have little or no scientific basis.
Although none of these lapses provides any reason to doubt that global warming is real, is man-made, and will create problems for us, these challenges to the IPCC are taking their toll.
Indeed, recent surveys show that the public is growing steadily less trusting of the scientific consensus on global warming.
The biggest headlines about IPCC errors concern a claim about melting Himalayan glaciers that it made in its 2007 report on the likely impacts of climate change.
“Glaciers in the Himalaya are receding faster than in any other part of the world,” the report noted, adding that “if the present rate continues, the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high.” As it happens, this prediction was not based on any peer-reviewed scientific research but was lifted from a report by the World Wildlife Fund, which was repeating an unproven speculation by a single researcher.
This lack of scientific basis did not stop countless global-warming activists from citing the glacier prediction at every opportunity.
When the Indian government suggested last year that the Himalayan glaciers were in better shape than the IPCC claimed, the IPCC’s chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, dismissed India’s objections as being based on “voodoo science.”
Earlier this month, the Indian government reacted to the revelations about the baseless nature of the glacier claim by announcing plans to establish what amounts to its own “Indian IPCC” to assess the impact of global warming.
India’s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, declared: “There is a fine line between climate science and climate evangelism.
I am for climate science.”
Climate evangelism is an apt description of what the IPCC has been up to, for it has exaggerated some of the ramifications of climate change in order to make politicians take note.
Murari Lal, the coordinating lead author of the section of the IPCC report that contained the Himalayan error, admitted that he and his colleagues knew that the dramatic glacier prediction was not based on any peer-reviewed science.
Nonetheless, he explained, “we thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact policy-makers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action.”
The concrete action that they had in mind was getting governments to mandate drastic cuts in carbon-dioxide emissions.
Activists have been pursuing this approach to tackling global warming without success for nearly 20 years, most recently at last December’s failed climate summit in Copenhagen.
The problem is that it is too expensive a solution for politicians and the public to swallow easily –which is why many well-meaning climate scientists have apparently concluded that instead of relying on reasoned discussion, they might as well try to scare us witless.
Consider what the IPCC had to say about extreme weather events such as intense hurricanes.
The cost of such events in terms of destroyed property and economic disruption has been rising steadily.
Every peer-reviewed study has shown that this is not because of rising temperatures, but because more people live in harm’s way.
Nonetheless, in the IPCC’s influential 2007 assessment of climate change, the panel’s Working Group II (charged with assessing the potential impact of global warming) chose to cite one, then-unpublished study that supposedly found that global warming had doubled damage costs over the past 35 years.
In fact, when this study was finally published, it stated categorically that there was “insufficient evidence” to link the increased losses to global warming.
In other words, what Working Group II reported was plain wrong.
Elsewhere in the 2007 assessment, Working Group II claimed that “up to 40% of the Amazonian forests” were at imminent risk of being destroyed by global warming.
The basis for this claim was a single report from the World Wildlife Fund that itself cited only one study, which didn’t even look at climate change, but rather at the impact of human activities like logging and burning.
In similar fashion, Working Group II claimed that “by 2020, in some [African] countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%.” Much quoted since, this alarming statistic turns out to have been based on a single, unreferenced bullet-point from a report by an environmental think tank.
There are numerous other examples of similar shenanigans by Working Group II.
Yet, aside from a grudging admission that its predictions about Himalayan glaciers were “poorly substantiated,” the IPCC has yet to acknowledge – much less apologize for – any of the lapses.
If the IPCC is to do to its job properly, it must own up to all of its missteps and clean house.
Nobody expects it to be infallible.
But neither should we tolerate its attempts to scare policy-makers rather than inform them.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s call for the European Central Bank to intervene to curtail the soaring euro is commonly seen as a sign that he neither understands nor trusts markets.
Indeed, some now view Sarkozy as a traditional Gaullist who wants to help French producers by artificially devaluing the euro.
But could Sarkozy be right in believing that currency markets do not automatically drive exchange rates to levels consistent with the fundamentals of international trade?
After all, comparable goods often sell internationally at very different prices.
For example, according to 
 The Economist
 ,
 a Big Mac hamburger sells in the euro zone for about three euros – roughly $4 at the current exchange rate – but for only about $3.20 in the United States, implying that the euro is overvalued by about 25%.
It is clear from the last three decades of floating currencies that market-determined exchange rates tend to swing widely and persistently from parity levels that would make comparable goods sell at comparable prices in different countries.
So politicians like Sarkozy may have grounds to argue that central banks should intervene to limit such swings.
But economists, including many central bank staff, usually do not see things this way.
Despite wide and persistent swings in actual currency markets, their so-called “rational expectations models” predict that exchange rates should not deviate from parity in any lasting way.
Believing that they have found a way to model precisely how currency traders should think about the future, they see no need for intervention because, save for temporary deviations, markets always get currency values right. 
In contrast, “behavioral economists” acknowledge that currencies can depart from parity for a protracted period, but argue that this results not from traders’ attempts to interpret movements in macroeconomic fundamentals, but from market psychology and irrational trading.
For them, intervention is not so much unnecessary as it is impossible.
Faced with wide swings, central banks are helpless to counteract traders’ irrational zeal to bid a currency further away from historical benchmark levels.
After all, speculative flows account for more than 95% of the $2 trillion traded daily in currency markets.
But both the “rational expectations” and the “behavioral” models are fundamentally flawed for the purpose of assessing policy interventions.
As different as they might appear, they attempt to generate exact predictions of human behavior, whether “rational” or “irrational.”
Both disregard the fact that rationality depends as much on individuals’ imperfect understandings of history and society as on their motivation.
They also ignore the importance for market outcomes of individual creativity and unforeseeable socio-political change.
Once this “imperfect knowledge” is placed at the heart of economic analysis, the implications of our inherently limited ability to predict market outcomes become clear.
When it comes to currency markets, parity levels based on international trade are merely one of many factors that traders may consider.
In attempting to cope with imperfect knowledge, they are not irrational when they pay attention to other macroeconomic fundamentals and thereby bid an exchange rate away from its parity level. 
The euro’s recent rise against the dollar is a case in point: by most accounts, euro bulls have been reacting to the enormous US current account deficit, a surging euro-zone economy, and rising euro interest rates.
What is irrational about factoring in such fundamentals when trading a currency? 
Of course, persistent swings from parity do not last forever.
While movements in macroeconomic fundamentals may lead bulls to bid the value of a currency further above parity, they simultaneously become more concerned about a counter-movement back to parity – and thus capital losses – which moderates their desire to increase their long positions.
This concept of risk builds on a neglected insight of John Maynard Keynes, who was keenly aware of the centrality of imperfect knowledge for understanding price fluctuations in asset markets.
Moreover, relating the riskiness of holding an open position in a currency market to the exchange rate’s divergence from parity levels suggests a novel way to think about how central banks can influence the market to limit departures from parity.
Every month, the central bank should announce its estimate of a 
 range
 of parity values, backed by analysis, which, unlike a precise value, reflects the inherent imperfection of knowledge concerning a currency’s parity.
As the exchange rate moves away from this range, the central bank’s regular announcements would heighten the concern of currency traders that other traders will consider it increasingly risky to hold open positions.
This should moderate their willingness to do so, thereby limiting the magnitude of the currency swing.
This strategy does 
 not
 imply that central banks should attempt to confine the exchange rate to a pre-specified target zone.
Given the enormous size of daily volumes in currency markets, such attempts almost always fail, leading to currency crises.
Instead, the “
 limit-the-swings” 
 strategy proposed here implies that, as the exchange rate moves further away from parity, central banks should use their reserves to intervene at unpredictable moments in order to reinforce the effect of their regular announcements of the parity range on traders’ perception of increased risk of capital losses.
Our proposal to reduce ­­– but not eliminate – swings from parity recognizes that price fluctuations may be crucial for markets to ascertain the price of assets that promise an uncertain payoff.
But currency swings, if too wide and protracted, can impede real economic activity, which is why intervention is sometimes necessary.
Only by explicitly acknowledging the limits to economists’ and policymakers’ knowledge would such policies have a chance of succeeding.
Sometime in the next two years a human being will likely be cloned.
This may or may not bring shudders of horror, but will certainly not occur outside the law or in some shadowy offshore location.
The medical, scientific, legal and political establishment will fully support the effort.
This clone, however, will never leave the British laboratory in which it was created. 
Last January, a form of human cloning called “therapeutic cloning” – or more properly “cell nuclear replacement” – was legalized in Britain.
As with in vitro fertilization, the British appear to have been the first to devise a regulatory scheme for morally contentious technology.
The world is watching what will happen next. 
It is rather like a Woody Allen script, but run backwards.
In Allen's 1973 film Sleeper, attempts are made to clone Hitler from his preserved nose.
Today, instead of cloning people from spare parts – or spare cells, as is the case with reproductive cloning – scientists hope to grow those parts by cloning people. 
The first part of this procedure is similar to that used to create Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal.
The nucleus from a human cell is inserted into an egg that had its nucleus removed.
An embryo forms, but it will not be implanted in a uterus.
Instead, embryonic stem cells will be derived from its inner cell mass.
These cells have the potential to become every cell-type in the body, a potential which may lead to cures for many chronic diseases.
Stem cells cannot become a baby. 
While Britain has legalized therapeutic cloning, they are poised to ban reproductive cloning.
They oppose projects such as that of Drs. Severino Antinori of Rome and Panayiotis Zavos of Kentucky in America, who plan to enable infertile men to become fathers by inserting their DNA into an egg from their partner. 
Reproductive cloning raises several moral issues – principally those of safety.
Scientists believe that human clones would have defects.
Because the egg that receives the new nucleus has to reprogram it quickly – teaching it to give the instructions necessary to construct an entire human being - genes that should be “turned on” might well be “turned off,” and vice versa. 
This probably explains why at least some animal clones have problems with their hearts, lungs, and immune systems.
Weight is a problem too.
Dolly the sheep – although still going strong five years after her birth, and the mother of six (all conceived the old-fashioned way) – has always been plump.
During a trip to the Roslin Institute where Dolly was cloned, I found her, shorn of her fleece and revealing an ample midsection, mournfully staring from behind a sign that said, "hay only."
The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson is not the only British celebrity on a diet. 
Being overweight is obvious.
Other defects may be subtler and, perhaps, insignificant for farm animals.
But where humans are concerned, safety must come first.
Because the defects found in clones are not genetic mutations, pre-implantation diagnosis at the embryo stage will not reveal their existence. 
Problems caused by these defects could emerge at any point in the person's life.
We would see a greater range of defects than we do in animals like mice because it is easier to analyze human behavior and physiology.
Therapeutic cloning would probably be safer than reproductive cloning because any reprogramming defects would not affect every cell in the body – just the cells used in therapy. 
Thus far, only the UK has legalized therapeutic cloning.
A law passed late last year in Japan permits it but forbids transferring the embryo to the uterus.
In March, Denmark’s Council of Ethics endorsed therapeutic cloning.
Will any country that legalizes therapeutic cloning inevitably slide down the so-called slippery slope and end up tolerating reproductive cloning? 
The idea behind a slippery slope is that if you do x, which is acceptable, you will end up doing y, which is not.
Indeed, two types of slippery slopes – logical and sociological – exist.
On the logical slippery slope, you slide to the bottom and embrace the morally unacceptable because there is no way to distinguish it from an acceptable practice.
You can slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to the other – even if the two are conceptually different – just because the existence of one creates a social climate receptive to the other. 
Therapeutic cloning is conceptually distinct from reproductive cloning.
Although the first step is the same, the intent behind the practices is not.
The former would be done in order to save lives by treating diseases now incurable – say, Parkinson's, ALS, and multiple sclerosis.
The latter – creating a person by cloning – would be done for reasons extending from egomania, to confusion between replication and resurrection, to the understandable desire to have a biologically related child. 
Will therapeutic cloning make it more likely that people come to accept reproductive cloning?
I don't think so.
Therapeutic cloning is intended to heal the sick.
The cells created through cloning would be an extension of the patient: a means to treat him with cells generated by his own body.
It’s almost like donating a pint of blood for yourself in case you need it for subsequent surgery. 
Even though I do not believe in a slippery slope from therapeutic to reproductive cloning, a society’s laws should give voice to its values.
In countries which allow for the former, it is probably a good idea to ban the latter.
PARIS: Three types of recessions exist.
The first type are those caused by major shocks, say an outbreak of war or a sudden, sharp increase in the price of petroleum.
Recall that the OPEC oil shocks of the 1970's incited two world recessions.
The second category of recessions arise by chance, for example when consumer confidence dips, or businesses become uneasy and cut back on investment and/or inventory.
This was the cause of America’s recession in the early 1990’s.
The third type of recession occurs when imbalances in an economy build up to unsustainable levels before exploding.
This form of recession is sometimes characterized by vast increases in debt (corporate or consumer), or by dizzying stock market or capital asset speculations that eventually come crashing down.
The “popping” of such an asset bubble is what happened in Japan 10 years ago, an event from which that country has not yet recovered.
Recessions of the first type are, almost by definition, largely unpredictable.
Those of the second type are minor and relatively easy to repair if not to avoid.
All that they usually require is a reduction in interest rates or a bit of reflation.
Recessions of the third kind are the most worrying.
Is America facing this third type of recession?
What, indeed, will be the nature of America’s next recession, that is, if America has a recession?
Optimists predict a recession of the second type; pessimists suspect that a third variety recession is lurking in the economic shadows.
Who is right?
The answer depends almost entirely on one single number: the growth rate of American productivity in the future.
After adjusting for inflation, America’s stock exchanges roughly tripled in value in the 1990’s.
Indeed, stock prices doubled compared to profits.
The savings rate for households has gone from 5% of American GDP in 1990 to zero in 2000.
America’s current account balance – the surplus of imports over exports – is now in deficit to the tune of 3% of GDP.
Do these figures reflect alarming imbalances or are they the usual signs of a boom?
If America’s rate of growth in the coming decades remains what it has been over the past thirty years, the answer is simple, and terrifying.
Stock market prices would be much too high.
Households would be behaving in a totally irresponsible manner.
The exterior imbalance would be unjustifiable, indeed, unsustainable.
If America’s annual rate of improvement in productivity turns out to be higher in the next thirty years than they have been over the past three decades, the country’s worries will be few.
High stock market valuations would reflect a radiant future, households would be behaving in a reasonable way, and America would be wise to run a trade deficit in order to invest.
Under such conditions, a mere nudge in interest rates by the Federal Reserve should set right any residual problem; if not, a tax cut will do the trick.
Any recession would likely be short and limited.
What level of improved productivity can America expect in future years?
Productivity growth will probably be higher than before 1995: the soaring growth rates of recent years are not accidents; the high tech explosion is real.
All the same, I still fear that improvements in productivity will turn out to be lower than the prophets of the New Economy promise.
This prospect literally gives me the shivers.
Not only may the future be less radiant, but the adjustments that will be required once reality sets in could set off a nastier recession and a more persistent slowing of the economy than anything predicted today.
In the second half of the 1990's, Europe's average annual growth rate of productivity amounted to 0.7%, while the US hummed along at 1.4%.
However, if we distinguish between the industries that produce information and communications technologies (ICT) and those that are simply users of such technologies, we can see that the productivity growth gap stems almost entirely from the weakness of Europe's ICT producing sector.
Annual productivity growth in sectors that are users of ICT technologies averaged 0.63% in the US between 1995 and 2000, and a very similar 0.41% in Europe.
This confirms a well known fact: Europe is less efficient than the US at producing research that is conducive to innovation--either because Europe allocates fewer resources to research, or because the available resources are used less efficiently, or both.
To be sure, total spending on research and development is lower in Europe than in the US, but not by much.
In the 1990's, the US devoted 2.8% of GDP annually on R&D, compared with 2.3% in Germany, 2% in the UK, and 1.9% in France.
Still, European governments typically complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support R&D (a far fetched argument given the miniscule share of research spending in the oversized European budgets) and, whenever the European Commission allows them, they subsidize innovative firms, or those that they think are more likely to invest in R&D.
France and Italy, for example, demanded that the limits imposed the budget deficits of euro zone members by the Stability and Growth Pact exclude public spending for research.
Similarly, the French government decided to bail out Alstom--a company that developed a number of high-tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train--before ending up bankrupt.
But both tactics are unlikely to boost the European high-tech sector.
Why?
Because weakness in research is not--at least not primarily--a funding issue.
Subsidies will not produce efficient high-tech firms.
Let us consider research first.
Europe trails the US in every dimension: the number of patents, the number of Nobel laureates, the number of researchers it is able to attract from the rest of the world.
But funding is only part of the problem.
A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the US for two reasons: incentives and the demand for technology.
We fear that spending more money without changing archaic university rules would produce more waste, not more research output.
It would only increase the power, prestige, and resources of entrenched lobbies of established university professors who often prevent entry and competition.
Demand for technology is also important.
It helps focusing research, it provides deadlines, screens the output, and allows patents to be valued at market prices.
Without the incentives provided by those on the receiving end of its output, research risks drifting along, often without clear direction.
Admittedly this is not true in all fields: the study of Ancient Greek fragments is valuable even it meets hardly any demand.
But it is important in those fields, both theoretical and applied, that might be used as an input in the production of new technologies: physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, etc.
But it is defense spending that is the major factor in the demand for research.
Most technological breakthroughs in the postwar period--from microchips to the Internet to the new batteries for cellular phones developed for the US Army in Iraq--had, at least initially, a military application.
Cell phones, satellite tracking, and high-resolution cameras are not cheap to come by, but happily for the industries that use them, costs for their development have been partly picked up by the government.
One key reason for the superiority of the US in research is the size and the composition of defense expenditure.
The Pentagon's budget is not simply big: it accounts for more than one half of all US government spending on research and development: in France, defense spending is only around a quarter of the total.
In 1999, US spending on defense-related R&D was 0.45% of GDP; the UK and France were next, but with just half as much, 0.26% and 0.22%, respectively.
As the Alstom case suggests, the French have a different model in mind.
Rather than supporting R&D with large defense budgets, they prefer to do it directly, subsidizing French high-tech firms.
The official justification is that national defense budgets are too small to create the demand that would be needed to support R&D in high-tech sectors, while there is still no European defense budget.
This is no coincidence: if allocated competitively, such a supra-national budget would identify winners and losers.
But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech firms might not make it: better, they think, to keep them alive with generous subsidies, and in the meantime avoid the consolidation of EU defense budgets.
By integrating its defense expenditures and increasing their size, Europe would hit two birds with one stone.
It would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international bargaining tables, particularly vis-à-vis the US, and it would stimulate scientific research.
The way to achieve these goals is not to run larger deficits, which merely imply higher taxes tomorrow, but to cut spending in other parts of the budget.
In short: short-run pain for long-run gain.
Now that the conflict over the cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad is dying down, or so I hope, it is clear that the only winners are the extremists -- in the Islamic World and in Europe.
I regret the fact that the controversy started in my own country when a newspaper chose to publish the cartoons in a naïve effort to demonstrate freedom of expression.
It happened last autumn, and at that time I argued publicly against what I regarded as an insensitive act, because it hurt other peoples’ religious feelings.
It was also an unnecessary provocation, and constituted in itself a caricature of our cherished freedom of expression, that is guaranteed in our constitution.
As my father (an old journalist himself) used to say: Freedom of expression provides a right to say what you think, but it is not an obligation to do so!
When the controversy blew up a few weeks ago, a lot of fuel was added to the fire.
Many incorrect stories were circulated.
False rumours that the Holy Koran had been burned in demonstrations, false information on the status of Islam in Denmark, incorrect translations of what our Queen had said, etc. This added to the anger, and it led to burning embassies and threats of violence.
The conflict has been called “A Clash of Civilizations.”
It could well deteriorate into that; the potential is there.
But I would still prefer to call it “A Clash of the Misinformed.”
There were so many mistakes on both sides: On one side there was a lack of understanding of the deep religious feelings that were hurt by a show of disrespect.
On the other side people were given exaggerated and even falsified stories of what had actually happened.
The potential for a “clash of civilizations” lies in the deep differences between European and Islamic cultures and traditions.
We should all be aware of those who seek to deepen these differences and turn them into insurmountable gulfs instead of inspirations to a richer life.
It is only too easy for them to point to the case of the cartoons and say: Now you see how western-style democracy and freedom of expression mean that you will face ridicule and mockery of your religious faith!
It is easy because freedom of expression was used, when publishing the cartoons, merely to demonstrate itself and therefore became a caricature of itself.
Our globalized world brings us not only economic opportunities but also cultural and spiritual challenges.
Internet and SMS have developed over less than a decade and we still have not made the mental adjustments to the implications of such instantaneous communication.
The Danish cartoonists and newspaper editors that published the cartoons obviously failed to understand that they were not just addressing themselves to a local audience but to other inhabitants of the global village.
If they had realized that, they would not have published the cartoons – as they stated clearly when they made their apology.
The lessons of this unfortunate incident seem to me to be clear: We should all acknowledge that in the modern world it is increasingly necessary for all sensible people to work for mutual respect, tolerance and better understanding.
We must avoid situations where different values are confronted with each other in ways that trigger violence.
Instead we must try to build bridges between religions, ethics and norms.
Call it self-censorship if you wish.
But self-censorship is practised all the time by sensible people.
If you wish to stay in the same room as other people you try not to offend them through unnecessary provocations.
The room we are talking about is no longer the local pond but the global village.
Co-existence is the key.
Some people are unwilling to accept this.
They are not open to values other than their own.
They want confrontations.
You find such people in Europe as well as in the Islamic world.
Unfortunately they are the beneficiaries of the conflict that was triggered by the cartoons in a Danish newspaper.
But if we do not stand up to them we all run a grave risk of repeating some of history’s great mistakes.
The risk was explained in a very small poem by the late Danish poet and philosopher Piet Hein in one of his famous “Grooks” called “That is the question”:
Coexistence
or no existence
European leaders need to get serious about Europe’s cocaine problem. The “white lady” is seducing a steadily growing number of Europeans, and remaining in a state of denial will only worsen the consequences.
Cocaine used to be America’s problem, to the point that the United States started a major campaign against sellers and consumers of crack cocaine in the inner cities, drug traffickers, and suppliers in the Andes.
But now demand for cocaine in most of the world is stable or dropping.
Coca cultivation has been slashed by a quarter in the past five years, and seizures of cocaine have almost doubled.
An impressive 42% of all of the world’s cocaine was seized in 2005.
Only Europe is bucking the trend.
Cocaine use is on the rise, especially in Spain, Great Britain, and Italy.
There is plenty of anecdotal evidence indicating traces of cocaine found on bank notes and in water supplies.
Here are some harder facts.
For the first time, the level of cocaine use in Spain – 3% of the population aged 15 to 64 – now exceeds that in the US.
And the United Kingdom is not far behind.
In 2005, 2.4% of the UK population used cocaine at least once, up sharply from 0.6% a decade earlier.
Consider another telling indicator.
Ten years ago, 20% of all new clients entering treatment for drug abuse in the Netherlands were addicted to cocaine.
Now it is 40%.
In Spain, the proportion has soared to 42% in 2002, from just 7% in 1995 – and it has no doubt risen again since then.
Europe’s growing cocaine problem is due to several factors.
First, drug users in Europe are switching to cocaine from heroin.
Cocaine is fashionable because it is attractive: white, not dark; sniffed, not injected; consumed in a living room or a fashionable night-club, not in a dark alley.
It is seen as a drug for winners, not losers.
To many it is a symbol of success, until they end up in a hospital or treatment center.
Cocaine use by high-profile entertainers, executives, models, and socialites who flaunt their illicit drug habit certainly does not help.
Nor does uncritical reporting by the media.
It seems many Europeans need to be reminded that cocaine is highly addictive and harmful.
That is why it is a controlled substance.
While addicts may be in denial, thinking that they can control their “recreational use,” cocaine, to quote the famous song by J.J. Cale, “she don’t lie.”

Second, too many governments – particularly in rich countries – fail to invest political capital in preventing and treating drug abuse.
They are ill equipped to deal with the problem, so their societies have the drug problem they deserve.
This raises a basic credibility issue: how can Europe urge Colombia and Peru to reduce supply when its own drug habit is driving cultivation?
The solution is to attack the problem at its source by addressing both supply and demand.
Coca crops in Latin America need to be replaced with agricultural crops, and cocaine use in affluent Europe must be reduced.
Solving the cocaine problem is a shared responsibility.
On the supply side, there must be more support for poor farmers in drug-producing countries to give them viable alternatives to growing coca.
Most illicit coca growers are extremely poor.
Crop eradication will not work over the long term if there is no legal economy to replace drugs.
Drug control and development assistance must therefore go hand in hand.
Environmental protection is also at issue.
Coca farmers and producers slash and burn forests, polluting streams with toxic chemicals and damaging fragile ecosystems.
The Andean region has less than 1% of the world’s land area, but more than 15% of its plant life.
Vast areas of vegetation are being destroyed for lines of white powder.
At a time of growing concern about climate change, Europeans should be made aware of the long-term destruction done to a precious and fragile habitat for the sake of a short-term high.
But controlling supply is not enough.
If all of Colombia’s farmers stopped growing coca tomorrow, unrestrained demand by the world’s 13 million cocaine users would quickly generate as much cultivation somewhere else.
Clearly, the ultimate challenge is to prevent drug abuse and to treat and rehabilitate drug users successfully.
Sweden is a good example of how to do it right.
Drug use there is a third of the European average – the result of decades of consistent policies (irrespective of changes in government) that combine tough punishment of dealers and comprehensive treatment for users.
The more that can be done to prevent people from becoming cocaine addicts, the less damage these people will do to themselves and their families, the less money will get into the pockets of criminals, insurgents, and terrorists, and the less damage will be done to the environment.
But nothing will be done until Europe wakes up and faces its pandemic.
President Bush recently drew an analogy between the current struggle against violent jihadi terrorism and the Cold War.
He is right in one respect: waves of terrorism tend to be generational.
Unfortunately, like the Cold War, the current “war on terror” is likely to be a matter of decades, not years.
But Bush missed another lesson implicit in his analogy: the importance of using the soft power of culture.
The Cold War was won by a combination of military power, which deterred Soviet aggression, and the attractive power of Western culture and ideas.
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, hammers and bulldozers, not artillery, brought it down.
Unfortunately, Bush has not learned this lesson.
Academic and scientific exchanges during the Cold War played a significant role in enhancing American soft power.
While some American skeptics feared that Soviet scientists and KGB agents would steal American technology, they failed to notice that the visitors vacuumed up political ideas alongside scientific secrets.
Many of these scientists became leading proponents of human rights and liberalization inside the USSR.
Some 50,000 Soviets – writers, journalists, officials, musicians, dancers, athletes, and academics – visited the United States between 1958 and 1988.
Aleksandr Yakovlev was strongly influenced by his studies at Columbia University in 1958.
Yakovlev went on to become a Politburo member and key liberalizing influence on Mikhail Gorbachev.
Oleg Kalugin, who became a high KGB official, said in looking back from the vantage point of 1997, “Exchanges were a Trojan Horse for the Soviet Union.
They played a tremendous role in the erosion of the Soviet system….They kept infecting more and more people over the years.”
Yet today, the Bush administration oversees a cumbersome visa program that has cut the number of such exchanges, particularly with Muslim countries.
Popular culture was also important during the Cold War.
Many intellectuals disdain popular culture because of its crude commercialism.
But such scorn is misplaced, because popular entertainment often contains subtle images and messages about individualism, consumer choice, and other values that have important political effects.
American films, for example, include sex, violence, and materialism, but that is not the whole story.
They also portray American life as open, mobile, individualistic, anti-establishment, pluralist, populist, and free.
As the poet Carl Sandburg put it in 1961: “What, Hollywood’s more important than Harvard?
The answer is, not as clean as Harvard, but nevertheless, further reaching.”
The line between information and entertainment has never been as sharp as some intellectuals imagine, and it is becoming increasingly blurred.
Some popular music lyrics can have political effects.
Cultural messages can also be conveyed by the way that sports teams or stars conduct themselves, or in the multiple images purveyed by television or cinema.
Pictures often convey values more powerfully than words.
Even the consumption of fast food can make an implicit statement.
As one Indian family described their visit to McDonald’s, it was stepping out for “a slice of America.”
Although the Soviet Union restricted and censored Western films, those that made it through had devastating political effects.
As one Soviet journalist commented after a restricted showing of films that were critical of American nuclear weapons policies, “They absolutely shocked us….We began to understand that the same thing would happen to us as to them in a nuclear war.”
Soviet audiences watching films with apolitical themes nonetheless learned that people in the West did not have to stand in long lines to purchase food, did not live in communal apartments, and owned their own cars.
All of this discredited the negative views promulgated by the Soviet media.
Even rock and roll played a part.
As one of Gorbachev’s aides later testified, “The Beatles were our quiet way of rejecting ‘the system’ while conforming to most of its demands.” Czech Communist officials sentenced a group of young people to prison in the 1950’s for playing tapes of “decadent American music,” but their efforts turned out to be counter-productive.
In 1980, after John Lennon was murdered, a monument to him spontaneously appeared in Prague, and the anniversary of his death was marked by an annual procession for peace and democracy.
In 1988, the organizers founded a Lennon Peace Club that demanded the removal of Soviet troops.
Lennon trumped Lenin.
The Cold War was won by a mixture of hard and soft power.
Not all of the sources of soft power were American – witness the role of the BBC and the Beatles.
But it would be a mistake to ignore the role that popular culture played.
One has to be careful in drawing lessons for today.
Eastern European cultures were more similar to Western cultures than are Muslim cultures.
In some fundamentalist circles, and among the terrorists, Western culture evokes repulsion, not attraction.
But even in Iran, where the ruling mullahs describe America as “the great Satan,” the young want to watch American videos in the privacy of their homes.
Polls in the Muslim world show that American culture remains attractive to the moderate majority.
It is American policies that have led to America’s unpopularity.
For a start, Bush could learn to get out of the way and encourage more popular and grassroots contacts.
Colombia is in better shape today than it has been for years, thanks largely to President Alvaro Uribe’s leadership, but it remains a bizarre place, one facing strange and intractable challenges.
Colombia’s FARC guerrillas have held some of their kidnapping victims for many years.
Child soldiers still linger in paramilitary groups, and there are compromising video recordings of leading Colombian politicians and drug lords.
Perhaps weirdest of all, there are imprisoned guerrillas who refuse to be set free, and a government that insists on liberating them, even against their will.
Uribe was re-elected just over a year ago by a landslide, a tribute to the popularity and effectiveness of his “democratic security” policy of combating both the guerrillas and the country’s generalized violence.
Latin America’s oldest standing two-party system was decimated in that election, as the Polo Democrático presidential candidate won more votes than the Liberal Party’s contender, finally giving electoral expression to left-wing forces that had never been able to see more potential for change at the ballot box than by fighting in the mountains.
Negotiations on Colombia’s Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States had been finalized.
Even the questionable deal Uribe cut with the right-wing paramilitary AUC groups, pardoning up to 30,000 of their members for often horrendous crimes in exchange for their disarmament, appeared successful.
With Uribe in charge, Colombia seemed to be on a roll.
But much of this success has since been squandered, with both Colombia and Uribe now in deep trouble.
The so-called parapolítica scandals have rocked Uribe’s government, forcing the resignation of some cabinet ministers, and embarrassing others, including the president himself.
Photographs, videos, and audio recordings of politicians and paramilitary thugs (including one who boasts of having personally killed more than 300 of his enemies) have discredited a political elite that, while never very popular, has now had some of the worst suspicions that many held about it graphically confirmed.
For years human rights activists and scholars suspected the obvious: the emergence of an enormous, vicious, well-armed, and well-trained parallel army to fight the guerillas was not some spontaneous act.
It was, many believed, a deliberate policy devised and carried out by the official military and the political elite to wage war “off the books.”
The parapolítica or paragate revelations seem to confirm another suspicion as well: the distinction between the paramilitaries and the drug cartels, like that between the guerrillas and the cartels, is a nuanced one.
Unfortunately, these revelations come at the worst possible moment.
Colombia’s FTA with the US was in danger the moment the US Republicans lost their majority in both houses of Congress last November.
Still, it seemed more likely to pass than the other two pending Latin American trade deals with Panama and Peru.
Now it appears that President George W. Bush’s closest ally in the hemisphere will not only have its FTA rejected, owing to human rights concerns in the US House and Senate.
Moreover, it might also lose Plan Colombia, the huge – and hugely controversial – American aid program that has funneled tens of billions of dollars into Colombia since the late 1990’s, ostensibly to fight the drug cartels, but also, in fact, to wage counter-insurgency.
Uribe has spent weeks directly and personally lobbying key American legislators, and he is undoubtedly his own best advocate.
But, just as former US Vice-President Al Gore recently refused to share a dais with Uribe in Miami, many members of Congress refuse to approve a trade agreement or an aid package that may link them to a government tainted by egregious human rights abuses, complicity with drug lords, or both.
The US has never really wanted to include human rights issues in trade agreements; at best, and only when forced, US presidents have consented to incorporating labor and environmental chapters.
The European Union thinks differently; in its economic cooperation and free trade agreement with Mexico, for example, it insisted on – and achieved – the inclusion of a “democracy clause” that made its economic benefits conditional on ongoing respect for democratic rule and human rights.
Colombia’s blemished human rights record is affecting its government’s international standing and providing ammunition for those who wish to sabotage the FTA.
For example, protectionist Democrats in the US Congress have been able to insulate themselves from charges of opposing free trade if they scuttle Colombia’s FTA, because they will most likely ratify the deals for Panama and Peru.
Can Uribe survive his current travails?
The answer is almost certainly yes, unless the parapolítica mess reaches him directly, or the US explicitly rejects the FTA and postpones or attaches conditions to renewal of funding for Plan Colombia.
Uribe’s political demise would hurt everyone, but the rejection of the FTA on human rights grounds could set a healthy precedent.
In a region where threats to democracy and human rights are growing, linking trade and economic policy to these considerations is not a bad idea.
Uribe may not deserve such a fate, but history works in strange ways.
For more than a quarter century, Israeli policy has been in conflict with that of the United States and the international community.
Israel’s occupation of Palestine has obstructed a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land, regardless of whether Palestinians had no formalized government, one headed by Yasir Arafat or Mahmoud Abbas, or with Abbas as president and Hamas controlling the parliament and cabinet.
The unwavering US position since Dwight Eisenhower’s administration has been that Israel’s borders coincide with those established in 1949, and, since 1967, the universally adopted UN Resolution 242 has mandated Israel’s withdrawal from the occupied territories.
This policy was reconfirmed even by Israel in 1978 and 1993, and emphasized by all American presidents, including George W. Bush.
As part of the Quartet, including Russia, the UN, and the European Union, he has endorsed a “Road Map” for peace.
But Israel has officially rejected its basic premises with patently unacceptable caveats and prerequisites.
With Israel’s approval, The Carter Center has monitored all three Palestinian elections.
Supervised by a blue-ribbon commission of college presidents and distinguished jurists, they have all been honest, fair, and peaceful, with the results accepted by winners and losers.
Hamas will control the cabinet and prime minister’s office, but Mahmoud Abbas retains all authority and power exercised by Yasir Arafat.
He still heads the PLO, the only Palestinian entity recognized by Israel, and could deal with Israeli leaders under this umbrella, independent of Hamas control.
He has unequivocally endorsed the Quartet’s Road Map.
Post-election polls show that 80% of Palestinians still want a peace agreement with Israel and nearly 70% support Abbas as president.
Israel has announced a policy of isolating and destabilizing the new government (perhaps joined by the United States).
The elected officials will be denied travel permits, workers from isolated Gaza barred from entering Israel, and every effort is being made to block funds to Palestinians.
The Quartet’s special envoy, James Wolfensohn, has proposed that donors assist the Palestinian people without violating anti-terrorism laws that prohibit funds from being sent directly to Hamas.
In the short run, the best approach is to follow Wolfensohn’s advice, give the dust a chance to settle in Palestine, and await the outcome of Israel’s election later this month.
Hamas wishes now to consolidate its political gains, maintain domestic order and stability, and refrain from any contacts with Israel.
It will be a tragedy – especially for the Palestinians – if they promote or condone terrorism.
The preeminent obstacle to peace is Israel’s colonization of Palestine.
There were just a few hundred settlers in the West Bank and Gaza when I became president, but the Likud government expanded settlement activity after I left office.
President Ronald Reagan condemned this policy, and reaffirmed that Resolution 242 remained “the foundation stone of America’s Middle East peace effort.”
President George H.W. Bush even threatened to reduce American aid to Israel.
Although President Bill Clinton made strong efforts to promote peace, a massive increase of settlers occurred during his administration, to 225,000, mostly while Ehud Barak was prime minister.
Their best official offer to the Palestinians was to withdraw 20% of them, leaving 180,000 in 209 settlements, covering about 5% of the occupied land.
The 5% figure is grossly misleading, with surrounding areas taken or earmarked for expansion, roadways joining settlements with each other and to Jerusalem, and wide arterial swaths providing water, sewage, electricity, and communications.
This intricate honeycomb divides the entire West Bank into multiple fragments, often uninhabitable or even unreachable.
Recently, Israeli leaders have decided on unilateral actions without involving either the US or the Palestinians, with withdrawal from Gaza as the first step.
As presently circumscribed and isolated, without access to the air, sea, or the West Bank, Gaza is a nonviable economic and political entity.
The future of the West Bank is equally dismal.
Especially troublesome is Israel’s construction of huge concrete dividing walls in populated areas and high fences in rural areas – located entirely on Palestinian territory and often with deep intrusions to encompass more land and settlements.
The wall is designed to surround a truncated Palestine completely, and a network of exclusive highways will cut across what is left of Palestine to connect Israel with the Jordan River Valley.
This will never be acceptable either to Palestinians or to the international community, and will inevitably precipitate increased tension and violence within Palestine and stronger resentment and animosity from the Arab world against America, which will be held accountable for the plight of the Palestinians.
Acting prime minister Ehud Olmert and others pointed out years ago that Israel’s permanent occupation will be increasingly difficult as the relative number of Jewish citizens decreases demographically both within Israel and in Palestine.
This is obvious to most Israelis, who also view this dominant role as a distortion of their ancient moral and religious values.
Over the years, opinion polls have consistently shown that about 60% of Israelis favor withdrawing from the West Bank in exchange for permanent peace.
Similarly, an overwhelming number of both Israelis and Palestinians want a durable two-state solution.
Casualties have increased during the past few years as the occupying forces imposed tighter controls.
From September 2000 until March 2006, 3982 Palestinians and 1084 Israelis were killed in the conflict, and this includes many children: 708 Palestinians and 123 Israelis.
There is little doubt that accommodation with Palestinians can bring full Arab recognition of Israel and its right to live in peace.
Any rejectionist policies of Hamas or any terrorist group will be overcome by an overall Arab commitment to restrain further violence and to promote the well-being of the Palestinian people.
Down through the years, I have seen despair and frustration evolve into optimism and progress and, even now, we need not give up hope for permanent peace for Israelis and freedom and justice for Palestinians if three basic premises are honored:
1.
Israel’s right to exist – and to live in peace – must be recognized and accepted by Palestinians and all other neighbors;
2.
The killing of innocent people by suicide bombs or other acts of violence cannot be condoned; and
3.
Palestinians must live in peace and dignity, and permanent Israeli settlements on their land are a major obstacle to this goal.
The lead story in a recent issue of the Daily Graphic , Ghana's most influential newspaper, was designed to shock: "Four Gay Men Jailed."
Homosexual acts are crimes in Ghana - and across much of sub-Saharan Africa.
Uganda's leader, Yoweri Museveni, is vehemently opposed to homosexuality.
So is Zimbabwe's embattled Robert Mugabe.
Namibia's President Sam Nujoma complains that the West wants to impose its decadent sexual values on Africa through the guise of gay tolerance.
Indeed, the global movement to fight discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS - which first surfaced as a "gay disease" in the United States - has elicited little sympathy for homosexuals in sub-Saharan Africa.
Only in South Africa have gays and lesbians won significant legal protections.
The arrests in Ghana, while typical of African bigotry towards gays, were all the more shocking because gays and lesbians actually thrive in Ghana's capital, Accra.
A country of 20 million people, Ghana is unusually tolerant.
Whites, Asians, and Middle Easterners mix well.
Ghana has never had a civil war - a badge of honor in conflict-prone sub-Saharan Africa - and three years ago staged a peaceful transfer of power from one elected government to another.
Although homosexuality remains taboo, gays seem safe.
Physical attacks against them are rare.
In Accra, a trendy street club named Strawberries is well known as a hangout for gays, and there are a few prominent, if still discreet, clubs where homosexual men and women gather.
One gay man has his own television show, even though his sexual preferences are no secret.
Precisely because gays seem so accepted, the arrests sent a disturbing message.
The paper that reported the story is owned by the government and sells more copies than all other newspapers combined.
In the day following its original report, the Daily Graphic went further in showing its revulsion over gay activities by publishing a lead editorial that blamed Europeans and Americans for "all the reported cases of homosexuality" in Ghana.
The paper alleged that the men had been enticed into such practices by a Norwegian, who gave them money and gifts in exchange for photos of them engaged in homosexual acts.
The Norwegian posted the photos on the Web and supposedly mailed printouts to his Ghanaian friends.
I am neither gay, nor Ghanaian, but I have spent considerable time in Ghana and I reject the argument - heard in other parts of Africa as well - that Western notions of sexuality have perverted Africans.
In my experiences, Africans simply have a moral blind spot on the subject of homosexuality.
Journalists seem especially ignorant.
Last year I worked in Ghana as country director of Journalists for Human Rights, a Canadian group that helps African journalists give voice to the voiceless in their society while raising awareness of human rights abuses. The editor of the Daily Graphic supported my organization, and I held training sessions for his newspaper's reporters and editors.
The sessions resulted in stories that highlighted mistreatment of women and children and the failures of government agencies to deliver promised services.
But when I complained about bias against gays, the editor responded that gays don't deserve any sort of protection.
Although this example may suggest that Africans are united against homosexuality, they are not; gay advocates are simply terrified of speaking out, frightened that their support will be interpreted as an admission that they are gay.
Two years ago, the silence was broken briefly by Ken Attafuah, who directs Ghana's truth and reconciliation commission, charged with investigating rights violations during two decades of dictatorships. "It should not be left to gays alone to fight for gay rights, because we are talking about fundamental violations of justice," Attafuah said.
"You do not have to be a child to defend the rights of children."
That point is lost in Ghana.
After the gay arrests, I spoke at the University of Ghana about media coverage of homosexuals.
While no one objected to the coverage by the Daily Graphic , no one denounced homosexuality either.
Instead I received a short dissertation from one of the female students on how older married women often proposition her in nightclubs.
Two other females said the same thing happens to them and asserted that lesbianism is widely practiced in Accra, if publicly unacknowledged.
Lesbianism is, of course, a less threatening practice to the men who run Ghana.
No African man is supposed to be gay, and physical contact between men is presumed to be innocent.
Yet contradictions abound.
Once, at a traditional ceremony, in which an infant child receives his tribal name, I watched the proud father and a half dozen male friends dance together before a crowd of well-wishers.
The movements of these men were sexually suggestive, and at times they touched, even held hands.
As I watched, a European next to me explained that such dancing is accepted, so long as the contact between the men is left undefined.
In Ghana and in much of Africa, a culture of silence exists around same-sex love - a culture that many Westerners, raised on a belief in rights and openness - find unacceptable.
Yet the notion of "coming out" may not be a solution for every African homosexual.
Notions of what is right and wrong often collapse under the irreconcilable tensions between tradition and modernity, the individual and the community.
In sub-Saharan Africa, I am reminded of the saying that silence is golden.
Under the cover of silence, gays refrain from provoking the conflicts that a more vocal advocacy of homosexuality would bring.
But the recent arrests in Ghana expose this strategy's true price.
CAMBRIDGE ­– Capitalism is in the throes of its most severe crisis in many decades.
A combination of deep recession, global economic dislocations, and effective nationalization of large swathes of the financial sector in the world’s advanced economies has deeply unsettled the balance between markets and states.
Where the new balance will be struck is anybody’s guess.
Those who predict capitalism’s demise have to contend with one important historical fact: capitalism has an almost unlimited capacity to reinvent itself.
Indeed, its malleability is the reason it has overcome periodic crises over the centuries and outlived critics from Karl Marx on.
The real question is not whether capitalism can survive – it can – but whether world leaders will demonstrate the leadership needed to take it to its next phase as we emerge from our current predicament.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Capitalism has no equal when it comes to unleashing the collective economic energies of human societies.
That is why all prosperous societies are capitalistic in the broad sense of the term: they are organized around private property and allow markets to play a large role in allocating resources and determining economic rewards.
The catch is that neither property rights nor markets can function on their own.
They require other social institutions to support them.&nbsp;
So property rights rely on courts and legal enforcement, and markets depend on regulators to rein in abuse and fix market failures.
At the political level, capitalism requires compensation and transfer mechanisms to render its outcomes acceptable.
As the current crisis has demonstrated yet again, capitalism needs stabilizing arrangements such as a lender of last resort and counter-cyclical fiscal policy.
In other words, capitalism is not self-creating, self-sustaining, self-regulating, or self-stabilizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
The history of capitalism has been a process of learning and re-learning these lessons.&nbsp; Adam Smith’s idealized market society required little more than a “night-watchman state.”
All that governments needed to do to ensure the division of labor was to enforce property rights, keep the peace, and collect a few taxes to pay for a limited range of public goods.
Through the early part of the twentieth century, capitalism was governed by a narrow vision of the public institutions needed to uphold it.
In practice, the state’s reach often went beyond this conception (as, say, in the case of Bismarck’s introduction of old-age pensions in Germany in 1889).
But governments continued to see their economic roles in restricted terms.
This began to change as societies became more democratic and labor unions and other groups mobilized against capitalism’s perceived abuses.
Anti-trust policies were spearheaded in the Unites States.
The usefulness of activist monetary and fiscal policies became widely accepted in the aftermath of the Great Depression.&nbsp;
The share of public spending in national income rose rapidly in today’s industrialized countries, from below 10% on average at the end of the nineteenth century to more than 20% just before World War II.
And, in the wake of WWII, most countries erected elaborate social-welfare states in which the public sector expanded to more than 40% of national income on average.&nbsp;
This “mixed-economy” model was the crowning achievement of the twentieth century.
The new balance that it established between state and market set the stage for an unprecedented period of social cohesion, stability, and prosperity in the advanced economies that lasted until the mid-1970’s.&nbsp;
This model became frayed from the 1980’s on, and now appears to have broken down.
The reason can be expressed in one word: globalization.&nbsp;
The postwar mixed economy was built for and operated at the level of nation-states, and required keeping the international economy at bay.
The Bretton Woods-GATT regime entailed a “shallow” form of international economic integration that implied controls on international capital flows, which Keynes and his contemporaries had viewed as crucial for domestic economic management.
Countries were required to undertake only limited trade liberalization, with plenty of exceptions for socially sensitive sectors (agriculture, textiles, services).
This left them free to build their own versions of national capitalism, as long as they obeyed a few simple international rules.
The current crisis shows how far we have come from that model.
Financial globalization, in particular, played havoc with the old rules.
When Chinese-style capitalism met American-style capitalism, with few safety valves in place, it gave rise to an explosive mix.
There were no protective mechanisms to prevent a global liquidity glut from developing, and then, in combination with US regulatory failings, from producing a spectacular housing boom and crash.
Nor were there any international roadblocks to prevent the crisis from spreading from its epicenter.
The lesson is not that capitalism is dead.
It is that we need to reinvent it for a new century in which the forces of economic globalization are much more powerful than before.
Just as Smith’s minimal capitalism was transformed into Keynes’ mixed economy, we need to contemplate a transition from the national version of the mixed economy to its global counterpart.
This means imagining a better balance between markets and their supporting institutions at the global level .
Sometimes, this will require extending institutions outward from nation states and strengthening global governance.
At other times, it will mean preventing markets from expanding beyond the reach of institutions that must remain national.
The right approach will differ across country groupings and among issue areas.
Designing the next capitalism will not be easy.
But we do have history on our side: capitalism’s saving grace is that it is almost infinitely malleable.
May 9th will be the mother of all celebrations in Moscow.
The victory over Nazi-Germany 60 years ago will be commemorated and the human sacrifices to this end honoured.
So far, so good.
But some nations will be missing from the party.
Two Baltic presidents have decided to stay home, because their hosts are not willing to concede that there is more to the history of WWII’s end than the victory over Hitler.
Their peoples had to face half a century of occupation because of a deal struck before the war’s onset by Hitler and Stalin, the so-called Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 that divided Eastern Europe between Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union.
I have to admire the third Baltic president – Vaira Vike-Freiberga from Latvia – who decided to go to Moscow, honouring what should be honoured, and speaking aloud about what should not be hidden.
By doing so she demonstrates the strong position her country has obtained as a member of NATO and the EU, and she will be the one riding the high moral ground.
It is a pity that the Russian leadership of today has chosen not to condemn the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact that damaged the development of the whole Baltic Sea region for so many years – and still is a source of political pollution threatening to poison relations between neighbors around the Baltic Sea.
I find it difficult to accept those who tend to describe the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact as only a measure to build up Soviet national security.
In the Baltic Sea Region we have a particularly difficult history to deal with, if we look at the last 90 years.
After the end of WWI and the old order – “Die Welt von Gestern” – the Baltic region saw bloody revolutions, terrible civil wars, fascism, communism, genocide, occupations, oppression, terrorism, deportations – you name it, in our part of the world we have indeed had our share of all the horrors of the modern history.
When the Cold War ended, it seemed clever to say that this was “the end of History.”
But if we believe that – if we put a lid on history and leave it behind us – we run a risk that history will resurrect itself with all its horrors.
Therefore we must come to terms with history, particularly in the Baltic Sea region, where such a reckoning is a fundamental precondition for building mutual confidence and cooperation.
If you want to open “new chapters” in relations between old adversaries, you cannot simply close “old chapters” by denying or suppressing history.
Nothing good comes out of doing so – and we have seen enough of that in the past.
For too many years the Baltic Sea was a blind alley on the political map of Europe – divided by the Iron Curtain.
It was not a “Sea of Peace” – as the communist propaganda tried to describe it – it was a Sea of Threats, a sea of insecurity and lost opportunities.
To my country – Denmark – WWII’s end meant a return to freedom and democracy, and we could use the rest of the 20th century to strengthen our freedom, bolstering it with affluence.
But to the three Baltic countries the end of WWII led to half a century of occupation and lost opportunities.
We know to day the cause: the secret protocol to the Treaty of Non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi-Germany, signed in 1939 – the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact – defining the spheres of interest of the two dictatorships in eastern Europe which led to the war with Finland, the occupations of the Baltic countries, the assault on and division of Poland, and probably also the occupations of Norway and Denmark.
In short, this pact with its excrescence had an enormous impact on the history of our region, right up to this day.
That it why it will continue to haunt us, continue to disturb normal relations between the countries in this region with so much unused potential, as long as we do not deal with it in a forthright manner.
Debating, recognizing, denouncing – whatever…. anything but suppressing!
You cannot build lasting future relations between countries that have each in their own way suffered so much, without coming to terms with the past.
It was not until 1989 that the existence of this protocol was officially admitted, thanks to the Glasnost-policy of Mikhail Gorbachev.
But too many people still have difficulties with acknowledging this pact for what it really was.
Such denial is in no one’s interest.
Not in the kind of Europe we still have to build – a Europe where big and small countries are assured that they share the same rights and obligations, where minorities feel safe, where basic human rights are accepted as an inextricable part of our political system, and where neighbors are regarded with respect and expectations, not fear and anxiety.
But it is no surprise that coming to terms with history can be damnably difficult.
The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard put his finger on one of the more fundamental problems: “Life must be lived forwards – but can only be understood backwards”.
In order to look forward with confidence, you also have to look back – and understand what went wrong.
Every leader in Moscow May 9th should remember this.
CAMBRIDGE: This month the United States Government issued a path-breaking report on the impact of long-term climate change on America's society and environment.
We know that human activity is causing serious and complex changes in the global climate, mainly through the effects of burning fossil fuels like oil and gas, and the effects of deforestation.
These activities raise the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which in turn has many effects: a rise in average temperature, a rise in the water level of the oceans, significant changes in the global patterns of rainfall, and an increase in "extreme weather events" such as hurricanes and droughts.
The new US study is the first systematic attempt to understand the long-term consequences of these climatic trends in a single country.
It is a project of such significance and scope that it should quickly be followed up by similar studies in other parts of the world.
The new report, "Climate Change Impacts on the United States" (available on the website www.gcrio.org) is a remarkable accomplishment, even though it is really only one step in a long-term effort to understand the interactions of climate, environment, and human society.
It was produced by a huge team of scientists working in different disciplines and different parts of the United States.
If there is one main lesson, it is that long-term climate change is for real, and is likely to have major impacts on US society.
If there is a second lesson, it is that those impacts are complex and varied, and depend very much on the characteristics of particular regions.
What is good for one part of the country, or indeed one part of the world, might be a disaster for another.
The report stresses that climate change will have several interacting elements.
The rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere B which is the main cause of the long-term climate change B might actually have some directly beneficial effects, since a higher concentration of carbon dioxide can stimulate the faster growth of some types of forests and some crops.
On the other hand, the effects on temperature, rainfall, ocean levels, flooding and droughts, and other climate patterns, will hurt some regions, while even helping some others.
Northern regions, for example, could enjoy a longer growing season for some crops, while more Southerly regions, which are already hot, might suffer from the adverse effects of rising temperatures.
A major novelty of the study is to analyze the impacts of climate change on several different regions of the US, and on several different sectors such as agriculture, health, water management, forestry, and coastal resources (many of which will be submerged or damaged by rising ocean levels and the increased severity of storms).
There are strong hints of what might go right or wrong, but also clear warnings in the report that much more scientific work will be needed to get more accurate results.
For example, the report relies on two different mathematical models of the atmosphere. These models point in similar directions about long-term trends, but they often give very different specific predictions.
Also, little is known about how fast our societies will be able to adjust to the future changes if we can see them coming.
The problem of climate change is undoubtedly one of the toughest global issues to address.
First, it is truly a global problem.
One country can't protect itself by behaving well (for example using energy efficiently) if other countries are not taking similar actions.
Second, it is a very huge problem, since the climatic changes in the coming decades are likely to be quite sizeable.
Third, it is a very complicated problem.
The scientific understanding of long-term climate change is still very limited, and even when it is understood, the effects of climate on society are complicated. And fourth, nations are likely to differ widely in their particular interests in this issue.
Some countries are major contributors to the problem; others are major victims. Victims and perpetrators might not be the same.
It is now vital for other countries to carry out "national assessments" of the effects of long-term climate change, following the example of the US study.
There is good scientific reason to believe that many tropical regions will experience vastly more damage from global warming than will temperate-zone countries like the US.
For example, the effects of global warming on Africa and India could be very severe, even though their economies have contributed very little to the overall problem (since Africa and India use so little energy per person, they also contribute very little to the build up of atmospheric carbon dioxide).
Some regions - especially in the tropics - might be big losers in this process, even though they themselves have done little to cause the problems.
Ironically, it is the poorest countries that have the least resources to carry out the needed analyses.
Donor agencies such as the World Bank should therefore help to fund such studies.
Unless these studies are done, poor countries might find themselves continuing victims of worsening climatic shocks, such as severe hurricanes, droughts, and flooding, without realizing that the events are not accidental, but the result of long-term patterns of global energy use.
By understanding those linkages better, poor countries will have a much better idea of how to prepare for the likely climatic changes in the future, and how better to represent their own interests in the future negotiations over global responses to climate change.
This, in turn, should help us to reach more realistic and sound global responses to this tremendous challenge.
BERKELEY – Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, made a splash prior to the recent G-20 summit by arguing that the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights should replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.
His reflections elicited nothing if not mixed reactions.
Sympathizers acknowledged the contradictions of a system in which a national unit is used internationally.
Central banks understandably seek more reserves as their economies grow.
But if those reserves mainly take the form of dollars, then their rising demand allows the United States to finance its external deficit at an artificially low cost.
In turn, this allows unsustainable imbalances to build up, leading to an inevitable crash.
Recent events have highlighted this problem – and Governor Zhou thus was right to call for a different system.
But skeptics question whether the SDR could ever replace the dollar as the world’s leading reserve currency, for the simple reason that the SDR is not a currency.
It is a composite accounting unit in which the IMF issues credits to its members.
Those credits can be converted into dollars and other currencies at the Fund, and can be used in official transactions among IMF member countries.
But they cannot be used in the other transactions in which central banks and governments engage.
They cannot be used to intervene in foreign-exchange markets, or in other transactions with market participants.
This means that the SDR is not an attractive unit for official reserves.
This would not be easy to change.
Despite the trials and tribulations of the American economy, dollar securities remain the dominant form of reserves because of the unparalleled depth and liquidity of US markets.
Central banks can buy and sell dollar securities without moving those markets.
There is also the convenience factor: dollars are widely used in a variety of other transactions.
As a result, not even the euro has seriously challenged the dollar as the dominant reserve currency.
Doing so would be even more difficult for the SDR.
But difficult does not mean impossible.
If China is serious about elevating the SDR to reserve-currency status, it should take steps to create a liquid market in SDR claims.
It could issue its own SDR-denominated bonds.
Better still, it could encourage other G-20 countries to do likewise.
They would pay a price, since investors in these bonds would initially demand a novelty premium.
But nothing is free.
That price would be an investment in a more stable international system.
Of course, an earlier attempt was made to create a commercial market in SDR-denominated claims.
Back in the 1970’s, there was some limited issuance of SDR-denominated liabilities by commercial banks and SDR-denominated bonds by corporations.
But these efforts ultimately went nowhere.
The dollar being more liquid, its first-mover advantage proved impossible to surmount.
Overcoming that advantage now would require someone to act as market-maker for private as well as official transactions and subsidize the market in its start-up phase.
The obvious someone is the IMF.
The Fund could stand ready to buy and sell SDR claims to all comers, private as well as official, at narrow bid/ask spreads competitive with those for dollars.
The dollar originally acquired international currency status in the 1920’s, when the newly established Federal Reserve started buying and selling dollar acceptances, backstopping the market and enhancing its liquidity.
If the international community is serious about the SDR as an international currency, it will have to empower the IMF to do likewise.
Again, there would be a cost.
The IMF would be using real resources to subsidize the market until private market-makers saw it as attractive to provide those services at comparable cost.
The Fund’s shareholders would have to agree to incur those costs.
But, again, what is this if not an investment in a more stable global monetary system?
Transforming the SDR into a true international currency would require surmounting other obstacles.
The IMF would have to be able to issue additional SDRs in periods of shortage, as when the Fed provided dollar swaps to ensure adequate dollar liquidity in the second half of 2008.
At the moment, countries holding 85% of IMF voting power must agree before SDRs can be issued, which is no recipe for liquidity.
The IMF’s management would also have to be empowered to decide on SDR issuance, just as the Fed can decide to offer currency swaps.
For the SDR to become a true international currency, in other words, the IMF would have to become more like a global central bank and international lender of last resort.
Before the crisis, such ideas would have been dismissed out of hand.
Even now they won’t materialize overnight.
But they are the real implications of Governor Zhou’s remarks.
NEW YORK – The near-complete collapse of financial systems worldwide has exposed fundamental weaknesses in their architecture and in how they are regulated.
In calling for measures to “guard against systemic risk,” the G-20 summit has begun the process of reconstruction by recognizing that the system in its entirety, not just individual institutions, must be regulated.
Unfortunately, the G-20 communiqué offers only more of the same prescriptions for managing systemic risk that the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), the United States Federal Reserve, and others have put forward.
These proposals have focused on the problems caused by poor transparency, over-leveraging, outsized financial institutions, tax havens, bad incentives for financial bosses, and credit rating agencies’ conflicts of interest.
All of these are important, but they miss a fundamental point.
No one now denies that the past year’s sharp downswings in housing and equity prices, which followed long upswings – far above historical benchmark levels – helped to trigger and fuel the crisis.
As these downswings continue, there is a danger that they, too, may become excessive, dragging the financial system and the economy even deeper into crisis.
Containing systemic risks, therefore, requires not just ensuring transparency and managing leverage in the system, but also recognizing that these risks vary along with asset values.  If institutions that were heavily exposed had understood this, they would have raised their capital buffers during the run-up in housing and equity prices in order to protect themselves against the inevitable reversals.
But, as we now know, they did not.
One reason for this failure is that pillar 1 of the Basel II Agreement, which outlines how banks around the world should assess credit risks and determine the size of capital buffers, makes no explicit allowance for long-swing fluctuations in asset markets.
Instead, it relies on value-at-risk (VaR) measures that link risk to standard notions of short-term market volatility.
The problem here is that these measures implicitly assume that risk declines when markets are doing well: they demand less capital during calm periods and more capital during volatile periods.
In effect, the presumption is that capital losses are random, so the sharp reversals and losses that usually ensue after excessive upswings in prices are disregarded in risk calculations.
Indeed, because standard measures of the probability of default fall when the economy is doing well and rise when it is not, capital requirements based on these measures tend to be pro-cyclical.
But this increases systemic risk, rather than reducing it.
The G-20 has now called for revising the Basel II standards so that capital requirements become countercyclical, and Spain’s experience with such requirements suggests that doing so is a step in the right direction.
But such revisions of Basel II are not enough, because bank portfolios – especially those of international banks with large trading books – are vulnerable to the risks stemming from long-swing fluctuations in asset markets.
As a result, not only are countercyclical measures needed, but banks’ capital requirements should vary inversely with the boom-and-bust fluctuations in the asset markets to which they are heavily exposed.
Banks’ defenses need to be fortified during excessive upswings in asset prices so that they are able to weather the inevitable reversals.
The connection between financial risk and asset-price swings emerges from the use of a new approach – Imperfect Knowledge Economics (IKE) – to understanding risk and fluctuations in asset markets.
This approach implies that more can be done to reduce systemic risk, beyond reforming how risk is measured and capital buffers determined.
IKE acknowledges that, within a reasonable range, the market does a far better (though not perfect) job in setting prices than regulators can.
But it also recognizes that price swings can become excessive, in the sense that participants may bid asset prices far from levels that are consistent with their long-term values.
History teaches that such swings are not sustainable, and that the more excessive they become, the sharper and more costly are the eventual reversals – and the graver the consequences for the financial system and the economy.
The lesson of this crisis is that excessive swings need to be dampened with a set of prudential measures.
One possible measure is to announce “guidance ranges” for asset prices, with targeted variations of margin and capital requirements, not to eliminate, but to help damp down movements outside these ranges.
The key feature of these measures is that they are applied differently depending on whether an asset is over- or undervalued relative to the guidance range.
Their aim is to discourage trading that pushes prices further away from the range and to encourage trading that helps to bring them back.
Improving the ability of financial markets to self-correct to sustainable values is the entire point of prudential regulation.
By contrast, wholesale restrictions on short-selling (and other such measures that pay no regard to whether an asset is over- or undervalued) – an option that some have suggested – could actually lead to greater instability.
Rules that are beneficial in some circumstances may become counterproductive in others.
So the idea that what the world needs now is more fixed rules will not do.
Unfortunately, contemporary economic theory, with its presumption of perfect price discovery in asset markets, has discouraged economists and policymakers from paying any attention to the role of asset-price swings in managing systemic risk.
Today’s global crisis shows that we can no longer afford to ignore this vital factor.
Many Europeans look at globalization and throw up their hands in frustration: the challenge of competitiveness seems so great.
But Europeans have an advantage in today’s global competition, for which we should thank Jean Monnet and Jacques Delors, who created the Single Market before globalization was a buzzword.
For it is open competition within the Single Market that enables Europeans to compete globally. 
But this alone will not suffice.
More daring policies are needed.
In 1991, my country, Estonia, was emerging from 50 years of Soviet-imposed backwardness.
I despaired over how long it would take to build the infrastructure needed for Estonian businesses to compete internationally.
Fortunately, the world was just then entering the new era of the information revolution, so by opting for the new infrastructure of information technology, Estonia was soon able to play on a level playing field. 
Investment by both the public and private sector permitted Estonia to reach by the mid-1990’s a level of IT that was above the EU average.
By 2000, Estonia’s IT development in government services and sectors like banking had reached a level attained by only a few other countries in Europe.
So a small and once developmentally challenged post-Soviet country was able to overcome seemingly overwhelming obstacles.
But I fear that the steps needed to emulate Estonia’s achievements may not be very welcome elsewhere in the EU.
Increasing government efficiency, reducing paperwork, and eliminating the temptations of corruption through innovative computerization would mean a smaller, leaner public sector. 
The same is true for the private sector.
For example, since the late 1990’s, around 98% of all banking transactions in Estonia have been Internet-based, so banks needed fewer tellers and fewer branch offices.
While large numbers of bank employees were laid off, Estonia’s emphasis on IT allowed it to become more competitive, with rising productivity fueling a sustained period of rapid economic growth – 11% in 2006.
But this alone will not be sustainable unless Estonia begins to produce its own innovations.
Now that Estonia’s competitiveness can no longer count on a low-cost labor force, it needs to generate new technologies.
Yes, Estonians invented Skype, the Internet telephone system, but in general Estonia, like the rest of Europe, is falling behind in both innovation and pure science.
Instead innovations come first and foremost from the United States, whose universities and laboratories attract the best and brightest from Europe, India, and China.
Europeans, meanwhile, suffer from their aversion to immigration, their children’s increasing avoidance of math, science, and engineering, and the fact that the EU is closing itself off from internal competition in services, one of the most competitive sectors in the world economy.
Lack of competition within the EU also has security implications.
Given the importance of energy in our lives, it is understandable that many EU countries want to shield their companies from competition, and so oppose liberalizing the energy market.
But the reality is that Europe’s single largest source of energy – Russia – uses energy as a foreign policy tool.
Recall that in May 2006, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia’s ambassador to Ukraine, said that Russia would be willing to reduce the price of natural gas it charged Ukraine if that country adopted a less pro-Western orientation.
If we are to avoid seeing the EU subjected to divide-and-rule
 policies that lead them to jockey for better gas deals, then a common energy policy – overseen by an EU Energy Commissioner with the negotiating heft of the Trade Commissioner – is vital.
Even Germany is a small country when negotiating on its own with Gazprom.
But for Europe to develop a common energy policy comparable to our common trade regime, it will need the 
 sine qua non
 of external policy: internal liberalization.
That imperative transcends energy.
Europeans worry about their lack of engineers, but they do little to promote science education.
Instead, when they recognize that they are having difficulty competing internationally, they resort to protectionism.
But this is a recipe for further decline in Europe’s competitiveness – one that we must reject sooner rather than later. 
BERKELEY – Back in the late 1990’s, in America at least, two schools of thought pushed for more financial deregulation – that is, for repealing the legal separation of investment banking from commercial banking, relaxing banks’ capital requirements, and encouraging more aggressive creation and use of derivatives.
If deregulation looks like such a bad idea now, why didn’t it then?
The first school of thought, broadly that of the United States’ Republican Party, was that financial regulation was bad because all regulation was bad.
The second, broadly that of the Democratic Party, was somewhat more complicated, and was based on four observations:
·        In the global economy’s industrial core, at least, it had then been more than 60 years since financial disruption had had more than a minor impact on overall levels of production and employment.
While modern central banks had difficulty in dealing with inflationary shocks, it had been generations since they had seen a deflationary shock that they could not handle.
·        The profits of the investment-banking oligarchy (the handful of global investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan Chase, among others) were far in excess of what any competitive market ought to deliver, owing to these banks’ deep pockets and ability to maneuver through thickets of regulations.
·        The long-run market-return gradient – by which those with deep pockets and the patience to take on real-estate, equity, derivative, and other risks reaped outsize returns – seemed to indicate that financial markets were awful at mobilizing society’s risk-bearing capacity.
·        The poorer two-thirds of America’s population appeared to be shut out of the opportunities to borrow at reasonable interest rates and to invest at high returns that the top third – especially the rich – enjoyed.
These four observations suggested that some institutional experimentation was in order.
Depression-era restrictions on risk seemed less urgent, given the US Federal Reserve’s proven ability to build firewalls between financial distress and aggregate demand.
New ways to borrow and to spread risk seemed to have little downside.
More competition for investment-banking oligarchs from commercial bankers and insurance companies with deep pockets seemed likely to reduce the investment banking industry’s unconscionable profits.
It seemed worth trying.
It wasn’t.
Analytically, we are still picking through the wreckage of this experiment.
Why were the risk controls at highly-leveraged money-center universal banks so lousy?
Why weren’t central banks and governments willing and able to step up and maintain the flow of aggregate demand as the financial crisis and its aftermath choked off private investment and consumption spending?
More questions arise from the policy response to the subsequent recession.
Why, once the magnitude of the downturn became clear, weren’t governments eager to step in to return unemployment to normal levels, especially in the absence of higher inflation expectations, upward pressure on prices, or even interest-rate increases that would crowd out private investment spending?
And how has the financial industry managed to retain so much political power to block regulatory reform?
Moreover, how to restructure the financial system remains unclear.
The Glass-Steagall Act’s separation of investment from commercial banking greatly benefited the established oligarchy of investment banks, but somehow the entry of competitors from commercial banks and insurers increased financial companies’ profits further.
There were significant profit opportunities for financial intermediaries that could find spare risk-bearing capacity, carve out securities to take advantage of it, and thus take a middleman’s cut from matching risks with investors who could gain from bearing them.
But the advent of derivatives concentrated risk rather than dispersing it, for there was even more money to be made by selling risk to people who did not know how to value it – or, indeed, what risks they were bearing.
And central banks’ failure to regard their primary job to be the stabilization of nominal income – their failure not only to be good Keynesians, but even good monetarists – raises the question of whether central banking itself needs drastic reform.
Back in 1825, the Bank of England’s Governor Cornelius Buller understood that when the private sector had a sudden panic-driven spike in demand for safe and liquid financial assets, it was the Bank’s responsibility to meet that demand and so keep bankruptcy and depression at bay.
How can his successors know less than he did?
It may even be the case that we ought to return to the much more tightly regulated financial system of the first post-World War II generation.
That system served the industrial core well, at least as far as we can tell from the macroeconomic aggregates.
We know for certain that our more recent system has not.
WASHINGTON, DC – Even as the squeeze in interbank lending has started to ease after the rescue of financial systems across the advanced countries, falling economic indicators have sent stock markets tumbling.
Pressures on emerging-market countries, which were once thought by many to have “decoupled” from the rest of the world, have intensified as foreign loans are called in and assets sold off.
With fear gripping consumers, companies, and countries worldwide, talk has turned from a moderate advanced-country recession to a major world depression.
A sense of despondency has set in that nothing can be done to stop it.
What is going on?
Were the measures taken two weeks ago to shore up the financial system simply wrong?
Absolutely not.
The provision of liquidity, the recapitalization of banks, more uniform deposit insurance across the advanced countries – these were all correct and necessary measures.
But they were only the first installment on what needs to be done.
In the advanced countries, the fall in asset values and, more generally, fear of what comes next has shattered consumer and business confidence.
Consumption is dropping, and companies are cutting investment.
The financial crisis has created a sharp fall in demand, what economists call a “Keynesian recession.”
To help confidence revive, there is no alternative but to use macroeconomic tools to boost demand and sustain output.
Monetary policy can be used in countries where interest rates remain high, but its effectiveness in a credit squeeze is likely to be limited.
Fiscal policy must, therefore, play a central role.
Fiscal expansion is always risky, as it adds to debt and raises dangers later.
But, given where we are, the benefits exceed the costs in countries with sustainable debt.
Emerging-market countries face an additional problem.
Not only must they contend with the prospect of falling exports and confidence; they also are the latest victims of a financial crisis that started in the United States, traveled to Europe, and now has swept across their borders.
Foreign banks are cutting credit.
Foreign investors are repatriating their funds on an unprecedented scale.
Ironically, the measures being taken to resolve the crisis in advanced countries are making it more attractive to bring money home, making life harder for emerging-market countries.
In order to shore up their financial systems and overall demand, emerging-market countries must be ready to take actions similar to those pursued by the advanced countries.
But the recent prosperity of many of these countries has come from access to global capital.
A sudden stop to such flows is a severe blow and raises special challenges that cannot be solved by these countries alone.
So the advanced countries must be ready to provide the required financing, and to do so on an unprecedented scale.
The alternative is the prospect of widespread debt default, banking controls, and protectionism – an outcome that would set back these countries, and the global economy as a whole, for years to come.
The IMF has the wherewithal to commit up to $250 billion.
We have set in motion the internal procedures and facilities that will allow us to provide resources quickly, with conditions limited to the core crisis-policy response at hand.
In addition, the Fund is working on a new liquidity line to provide resources immediately to strongly performing emerging markets with sound policies and fundamentals.
This should give confidence to investors.
But, given the scale of capital flows, I am also urging the governments and central banks of the advanced countries to provide parallel financing to the IMF’s crisis-response programs.
I also am convinced of the need to find ways to bring into play the resources of countries with large reserves.
The Fund will play its part, but all these actions are needed to reinforce the credibility of the coordinated global response to the crisis.
We must also think ahead – especially in regard to low-income countries in Africa.
Because of their limited participation in international financial markets, these countries have, so far, been somewhat shielded from the storm.
But it is an uneasy calm that probably will not last.
Many low-income countries will suffer from the decline in commodity prices.
Others, including those that were becoming the new frontier in emerging markets, may see their access to foreign capital dry up.
They, too, will need help from the international community.
Lending by the IMF and global development banks, and the maintenance of donor aid at current levels, will be essential if we are to avoid new human tragedies.
The dynamics of fear are potentially catastrophic, but these dynamics can be broken.
Whatever the problems in the financial system, the massive improvements over the years in technology, productivity, and social progress – the real fundamentals – are a genuine testament to the power of globalization as a force for good.
It may be too late to avoid a recession in the advanced countries and a slowdown in emerging and low-income countries.
But it is not too late to avoid a global depression.
CAMBRIDGE – Around the world, demand for fresh water doubles every 20 years, owing to increasing population and affluence.
Yet pollution, climate change, and seawater intrusion are diminishing supplies of fresh water at similar rates.
So, is a global fresh water crisis looming?
Fortunately, the situation appears to be less alarming.
This is not to deny that the supply of fresh water is getting tight.
Left unattended, major disruptions for human society could occur. 
Many argue that water is different from resources such as oil, because there are often no substitutes for water in most uses (particularly growing food).
Moreover, water is an essentially fixed resource, albeit one that renews itself every year. 
There are prodigious quantities of water on the globe, but most of it is salty ocean water and brackish groundwater.
There are huge resources of fresh water, but most is in ice sheets and glaciers, with only a small percentage readily available where and when we need it.
The supply of water is also highly variable across regions and within countries, with floods and droughts occurring at irregular times. 
One new factor influencing water supplies is rising global temperature.
Although we are not certain about the exact effects, many scientists believe that total annual precipitation will increase, but that its seasonality and the frequency of extremes may also increase.
This would make it difficult to use the existing supply infrastructure of dams, reservoirs, treatment systems, and pipelines without big modifications.
From the writings of the earliest modern commentators on the drivers of socio-economic growth and decline – Adam Smith, Edward Gibbon, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx – we see that concern about exhausting resources is not new.
Malthus and Ricardo were particularly prescient about the roles of population, food, and energy resources.
Malthus postulated a geometric rate of population growth (like compound interest on a bank deposit) and an arithmetic rate of growth (simple interest on a bank account) of food production.
These curves always intersect after a couple of decades, and Malthus predicted widespread famine or violent conflicts: food and population would be aligned with each other by “misery, war, pestilence, and vice.” 
Ricardo projected “declining returns” on investments in resources, whereby the best (least-cost) resources are used first, followed by the next best, and so on.
Increasing demand for resources leads to price increases that will continue until the resource becomes too expensive to use.
Of course, these constraints were at work over previous centuries, before Malthus and Ricardo articulated them, but 
 homo sapiens
 was able to “cheat” by expanding our resource base (colonialism) to bring in cheaper resources and food; by finding substitutes for scarce resources; and by improving our technology so that the same amounts of land and resources could be used more efficiently.
Because the world is now pretty much filled up, there are few opportunities to expand the physical supply of resources.
The real question now facing the planet is whether we can continue improving our technologies or finding cheaper substitutes.
Just because something worked over the past 200 years does not mean that it will necessarily continue to work.
This is the crux of the problem facing global water resources.
But we can avoid a crisis by embracing the following technical and managerial adaptations:
&#160;- Trade virtual water – the amount of water that is embodied in producing a product (usually food) and shipping it somewhere else to be used.
This saves the recipient from using his own water, which can be saved for higher-value activities;
- Conserve irrigation water.
Because agriculture routinely accounts for 75-90% of all water consumed in a country, a 10% efficiency gain would save as much water as all the water used by the country’s municipalities and industry.
Another way of improving irrigation efficiency is by developing crops that produce more food with the same, or less, water.
Research on such genetically modified (GM) foods is well advanced in several of the largest water-scarce countries, such as China and India;
- Exploit advanced desalination.
Modern developments in desalination have brought the cost per unit of desalinated seawater to levels comparable to obtaining fresh water from natural sources (approximately US$0.05 per cubic meter).
- Expand wastewater recycling.
Urban areas typically dispose of about 85% of their fresh-water intake as wastewater, often in neighboring water bodies.
The wastes could be treated and used to replenish groundwater.
Emerging low-water-using sanitation technologies such as urine-separating dry-composting toilets could also significantly reduce urban water demands if properly developed;
- Develop creative pricing policies for urban water and wastewater.
Protecting human and ecosystem health are difficult to price, because they form part of the pervasive externalities associated with water use.
Nevertheless, many water uses would respond well to more efficient prices.&#160; 
Although avoiding a global water crisis will not be easy, we have at hand policies and technologies that, if properly applied, could see us safely through the next several decades, even in the face of increasing – and increasingly wealthy – populations.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson is to be replaced by the Brazilian Sergio Vieira de Mello, a longtime UN diplomat, on September 12 th .
That transition will be a tricky one, because the governments that dominate the UN commission for human rights (CHR) are increasingly trying to protect themselves - and their allies - from any scrutiny or criticism.
During the last annual session of the CHR, held in Geneva last spring, the body voted one by one to ignore severe human rights violations in such places as Russia/Chechnya, Zimbabwe, Iran and Equatorial Guinea.
For several other violators - such as China, Algeria, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia - the CHR couldn't even muster the will to put their abuses on its agenda.
It also cut back on several country-specific monitoring mechanisms, compromising one of the most powerful of human rights tools, that of naming and shaming.
This is happening, in part, because countries with vile human rights records - Algeria, Burundi, China, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Kenya, Libya, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Vietnam - command a powerful bloc within the CHR. They compose a near majority on the fifty_three member body.
In 2003, Zimbabwe will joined them and, unless African countries reverse an earlier decision, Libya will chair this body for a year!
Such countries go out of their way to secure seats on the commission and then actively work to build alliances with pliable governments.
In addition, they have developed a number of clever procedural ploys to undermine the commission.
Their resolve to render the commission toothless is not matched by a balancing impulse on the part of the traditional promoters of human rights in the West.
To some extent, this is because - all rhetoric notwithstanding - human rights rank relatively low among these governments' priorities.
Trade often trumps human rights and governments, especially in Europe, are often loath to jeopardize lucrative contacts when governments that violate human rights retaliate at being criticized.
These tendencies have been compounded more recently by the war against terrorism.
Western democracies are unwilling to irritate important allies in the counter-terrorism struggle simply because they might be violating the rights of their own citizens.
During the past year, for the first time in its history, the US was not a member of the Commission (though it will be regaining its seat in 2003).
You might think that America's absence contributed to the CHR's sorry state as, in the past, the US was often principled and outspoken on some issues, in particular regarding certain specific abusive countries.
But you would be wrong.
Increasingly obsessed at the prospect of its own citizens and practices coming under international scrutiny, America has over the past few years contributed to the general erosion of the UN human rights monitoring system.
It adamantly opposed several important and promising new human rights initiatives, notably the International Criminal Court (ICC), and a new anti-torture mechanism.
On the anti-torture protocol, the US sought to derail the creation of a universal system of visits to places of detention, under an optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture.
Here America found itself allied with some strange bedfellows that it normally rebukes as chronic human rights violators - Cuba, China, Iran, Libya, Sudan or Zimbabwe. Yet, without US support, the initiative was overwhelmingly endorsed in late July by the UN's Economic and Social Council.
Of course, not everything in the UN's human rights picture is uniformly bleak.
The International Criminal Court will be beginning its work soon, and with greater international support than expected, thanks to America's efforts to undermine it.
The universal system of visits to places of detention is gaining ground.
Even at the CHR, there has been some recent progress, for example, on work to establish "disappearances" as an international crime.
Here, countries with fresh memories of repressive rule, such as Latin American and East European nations, have increasingly taken the lead in promoting human rights initiatives and defending the principles.
(Latin America, in particular, played a pivotal role in all the situations described above.)
All the same, manipulation by powerful countries and the foes of human rights have left the CHR in bad shape.
Vieira de Mello - who has had a distinguished career in the UN system and is a brilliant diplomat - must be willing and able to draw on his own region and on others to make sure that the UN human rights system serves the victims rather than the violators.
But he will also need to entice the West into becoming more pro-active and the US in particular into re-establishing its role as a constructive rather than destructive force in human rights affairs.
On July 23 millions of Turks will wake up into a new, post-elections Turkey.
What will happen is hard to foresee.
Turkish politics is full of surprises that only foreigners find surprising .
Today, and this seems to surprise most people outside Turkey, it is women, not men, who are at the heart of political debate.
Indeed, in these elections the number of women candidates from all parties has visibly increased and so has female political overall activism.
This election is taking place because when the AKP party, the conservative party now in power, designated Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as its candidate for president, the country’s secular elite cringed.
Gul was not the issue; the issue was his wife.
Had Gul been chosen as president, Turkey would have had its first headscarf wearing First Lady.
Gul’s wife’s headscarf was interpreted as the symbol of darker changes to come.
If the First Lady wears a headscarf, maintained the secular-minded elite, the whole secular system could be undermined.
What followed was unprecedented political turbulence, including mass demonstrations on a scale never seen before.
There was feverish talk of a possible military takeover, and the army again proved itself to be a seminal political actor.
Through all this, Turkish women were at the forefront.
In particular, Turkey’s Westernized, modernized, secular women seemed determined to show their opposition to the existence of “the other” Turkish woman.
Gender issues have always been vital in the Turkish nation-state.
Kemalism (the beliefs associated with the founder of modern Turkey, Musfafa Kemal Atutűrk) is unique among all Muslim reform movements in that it transformed not only the public sphere, but also the private sphere – the domain of mothers, wives, sisters, daughters.
In the 1920’s and 1930’s – the years of Atutűrk’s rule &#45;&#45; the “new Turkish women” became the icon of the modern, secular regime.
The difference between what the French call laicité and secularism is more than a linguistic nuance for Turkey, which adopted its Kemalist system not long after France entrenched its secular republic.
Religious symbols and references have to a large extent been removed from the public sphere here, and religion is thought to be a private matter.
Many Turks who go to the US for the first time are puzzled, indeed, by its religiosity .
It comes as a surprise to see religious symbols and statements at the entrance of public buildings, on money, inside the courtroom.
But in Turkey the headscarf is not seen as a trivial symbol.
Eighty years after the republic’s founding the trouble with headscarved women is that they do not fit into the picture of the ideal modern Turkish woman.
At the first glance there seems to be a huge mental, cultural and political gap dividing Turkey’s women.
Yet if we look closer this gap becomes illusory.
In everyday life the two types of Turkish women are more mixed than they are usually assumed to be.
It is not uncommon for one sister to wear a headscarf while another does not, or a mother to wear a headscarf while her daughters do not.
Sometimes among two best friends, one is covered and one is not.
Any stroll along a crowded Istanbul street will show covered and uncovered women effortlessly &#45;&#45; almost naturally &#45;&#45; mixing.
Why then can’t a similar sisterhood be achieved in the realm of politics?
A recent opinion poll shows that around 60% of women in Turkey cover their heads outside their homes.
But does this mean 60% wear the veil?
Does it mean that they all support Islamic fundamentalism?
The answer to both questions is negative.
As a novelist, when writing in Turkish I can encounter more than eight different words to stand for the headscarf. Yemeni, türban, eşarp, çarşaf,… Each is different.
Different women wear the headscarf for different reasons.
Some wear it out of habit or for traditional reasons rather than religious ones.
For others the motivation is political.
Not all women wear a headscarf because of religious conservatism.
And not all headscarved women are “ignorant” or “repressed.”
But this complexity is lost due to the concept of “the veil.”
If one makes no distinctions and disregards nuances one will end up believing that 60% Turkish women wear the veil.
The same poll, however, revealed that the percent of women who cover their heads fully and for more political than traditional reasons is no more than 11%.
Paying attention to nuances makes a huge difference– the difference between saying that 60% women wear the veil and saying that 11% do.
This complexity is lost not only on Western observers but also on Turkey’s elite.
Because ideological clashes here seem to center around women’s bodies and clothes perhaps it is time we stopped asking “how should an ideal Turkish woman look?” and start asking “should there be an ideal woman Turkish woman at all?” After all, pluralism is not only a political principle, it is one a free society applies to individuals – male and female – as well.
We in Turkey have been tackling the question of whether Islam can coexist with Western democracy for more than 150 years.
After150 years of Westernization and modernization, the answer we have come up with is a definite “yes.”
Turkey is a complicated country, with multiple dilemmas.
Its women both heal and intensify its tensions.
WASHINGTON, DC – The world does not need to be reminded of the urgency of this historical moment.
We sense it every day in the news.
One day a major bank, insurance company, or automaker announces a record loss. The next brings word about the impact on nations and peoples least able to cope with these blows – the poorest of the world’s poor.
During the last two years, I have dealt with many crises, from Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo to such global challenges as the food crisis and climate change.
But the financial crisis is unique and potentially overwhelming.
What was a purely financial crisis has become an economic crisis, spreading across the globe.
Every projection of growth has been revised downward.
And while there are signs that mature economies are recovering from the panic that froze credit markets, we are by no means beyond the danger zone.
My greatest concern is that today’s financial crisis evolves into tomorrow’s human crisis.
We need to recognize what Martin Luther King, Jr. called the “fierce urgency of now” if we are to safeguard millions of people’s livelihoods and hopes for the future.
Many financial experts have diagnosed the causes of the crisis.
Policymakers have offered prescriptions for solving it.
We hear talk of new banking regulations and even of a new global financial architecture.
All this is desirable.
Yet, while I welcome this debate and fully recognize the need for long-term measures, I am acutely conscious of time.
Immediate problems require immediate responses.
Nor can we allow the financial crisis to become a reason for neglecting other critical issues: unacceptable levels of poverty and hunger, the food crisis, climate change.
For that will only exacerbate the already fragile political and security situation in many of the hardest hit countries.
At the G-20 financial summit in Washington this weekend, I delivered four messages reflecting my conversations with various UN member states.
First, we need a global stimulus package to turn this crisis around.
The IMF recently projected that virtually all global growth in 2009 will come from emerging and developing economies.
Large increases in public and private expenditures will therefore be required in many regions of the world to counteract falling demand.
Second, these financial rescue and assistance packages cannot stop at the borders of the richest countries.
Emerging markets and other developing countries will need oxygen in the form of credit lines and trade financing.
And we must stand against protectionism.  Without open trade, growth and development could break down entirely. 
Third, some part of our global stimulus should come from commitments that the international community has made on aid.
In today’s environment, fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is more than a moral imperative.
It is a matter of pragmatic economic necessity.
Finally, inclusivity must be our watch-word.
In our interdependent world, these tasks can be met only through reinvigorated multilateralism – one that is fair, flexible and responsive, with leaders coming from all quarters.
While the G-20 nations whose leaders met in Washington account for nearly 80% of world production, trade and investment, more than 170 other countries, representing one-third of the world’s people, were not there.
It is our responsibility to listen to their voices and respond to their concerns.
The next few months will be crucial.
Many of us will meet again in two weeks in Doha to review progress on financing for development.
Six years ago, President George W. Bush and other leaders adopted the ambitious goals that constitute the core of the MDGs.
History will judge us harshly if we fail to live up to these commitments.
I therefore urge all nations, rich and poor, to send their highest-level representatives to Doha with full determination to do what must be done.
In December, our climate change negotiators meet in Poland.
We have one year until they meet in Copenhagen – one year to reach an agreement that all nations can embrace.
The sooner we have such an agreement in place, the sooner we will see the green investments and green growth we so badly need.
The great challenges before us are interrelated: the global economy, climate change, and development.
We need solutions to each that are solutions to all.
NEW YORK – It is not every day that one gets to join two global powerhouses to promote a planetary breakthrough, but that is the reality with Connect to Learn (www.connecttolearn.org), a new worldwide initiative to ensure that all children on the planet can attain at least a secondary education.
The telecommunications giant Ericsson and the pop singer Madonna are teaming up to get kids into school and connected worldwide through wireless broadband.
My colleagues and I at the Earth Institute and the Millennium Promise Alliance are joining the effort.
The stakes could not be higher – or the prospects more exciting.
The information-and-communications-technology (ICT) revolution is surely the most powerful single force for economic development in the world today.
It is not just in New York, Shanghai, or Paris that one finds a mobile telephone in the hands of each passerby.
These days, one finds mobile phones in Nairobi taxis and among camel-herders in Northern Kenya.
There are now 4.6 billion mobile subscribers, and the numbers are soaring.
An estimated 250 million subscribers live in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.
The spread of 3G (and soon 4G) offers the prospect of a technological breakthrough in education.
Suddenly, even remote schools can connect to the Internet and to other schools through a solar panel, low-cost computers, and wireless access.
A school that lacked even rudimentary supplies suddenly can have access to the same global store of information as any other place in the world.
When it happens, the results are galvanizing.
Within minutes of going online in a pastoralist community in northeast Kenya, kids were reading about their own community as part of the Africa-wide Millennium Villages Project.
Communities that had little school attendance have seen kids stream in as low-cost interventions, starting with Internet connectivity, in-school meals, and a safe water supply, lead to a surge in schools’ quality, performance, and attractiveness to students and parents.
With modest up-front financing, impoverished and traditional rural communities that had not considered educating girls suddenly see the immense value to the community of educating both boys and girls.
In a Millennium Village in Ethiopia that I recently visited with the country’s health minister, a local father explained to me how he had decided to keep his daughter in school rather than marrying her at age 12 to a neighbor’s son. “I asked my daughter what she wanted to do,” the father explained, “and she told me that she wants to stay in school, so she is continuing in school.”
The health minister turned to me and said that he had never before heard such a conversation in that region: that the father would not only ask the daughter, but happily heed her decision!
We are seeing such rapid changes throughout Africa.
Impoverished communities are cheering the prospect of a rapid ramp-up in girls’ education, if meager resources permit.
On a sunny day in Malawi recently, Madonna and the CEO of Ericsson, Hans Vestberg, attended the groundbreaking for a new girls’ school and launched the new global education initiative.
On the horizon in two directions, spaced at around four kilometers, were the mobile towers to connect the new school with the world.
The promise was not lost on the national government.
The education minister committed to scale up education nationally as rapidly as resources would permit.
Universal secondary education, especially for girls, is transformative for societies attempting to escape poverty, because education changes the demographic dynamics of the country as well.
In the poorest parts of the world where girls are still not in secondary school, they are married at a young age and have 6-8 children on average.
Those who stay in school end up marrying much later, perhaps in their early to mid-twenties, entering the workforce, and having 2-3 children.
The interplay of voluntary fertility reduction and declining poverty are profound and rapid.
When poor families have fewer children, they can afford to invest more per child in health, nutrition, and schooling.
Mothers can spend more time in the job market, breaking long-standing barriers of gender inequality.
Reduced population growth means less pressure on land, water, and biodiversity.
In short, the links between education and reduced fertility, faster economic development, and lower environmental degradation are too powerful and obvious to be ignored.
Connecting kids around the world in shared on-line curricula, and facilitating “social networks” of kids around the world at an early age, will yield far-reaching educational benefits.
At a recent launch of a “school-to-school” link connecting an elementary school in the United States with one in Kenya, young children across an 8,000-mile divide shared a “read-aloud,” and then reflected in amazement and delight that they could share a story with kids in another part of the world.
The Teachers College at Columbia University will watch the school-to-school process carefully, with formal monitoring methods, to assess the value of school experiences in terms of expanded cognitive and ethical learning.
Current estimates suggest that around 300 million school-age children worldwide are deprived of the chance to complete secondary school, largely for economic reasons.
That deficit, which threatens the futures of these kids and their societies, can now be closed at low cost.
A Global Fund for Education, combined with a global voluntary effort to connect kids around the world, offers the chance for a breakthrough that was not realistic even a few years ago.
Such initiatives are another dramatic example of a basic truth of our time: extreme poverty, illiteracy, and death from preventable diseases are anachronistic scourges when we have the technologies and global goodwill to end them.
The Iraq war's main consequences will not be on the battlefield.
They will come later, and will depend on whether George Bush and Tony Blair can justify their onslaught on a largely defenseless population.
They launched this war for certain declared reasons, all of which were heatedly debated around the world.
If they are vindicated, then the war could conceivably bring a safer world.
If their arguments remain unproved or are disproved, then the war will incite instability.
In that case, a critical step towards healing the world would be their quick departure from office.
The Iraq War was not and could not be justified on the basis that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant.
Justification, if it exists, rests on the danger Saddam's regime posed.
Bush and Blair made four claims:
Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction;
those weapons pose a grave, immediate threat;
UN inspections were not eliminating that threat;
the threat could best be eliminated by war.
The first claim should be the easiest to verify.
Bush and Blair talked repeatedly about stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, massive underground and mobile units to produce or launch such weapons, and active programs to obtain nuclear weapons.
It is incumbent upon Bush and Blair to prove their case, and to prove it in the face of worldwide suspicion that the US and UK security agencies might plant phony evidence.
For this reason, independent UN experts should assess any evidence that is uncovered.
If no evidence of such weapons is produced, then both Bush and Blair deserve to be finished politically, no matter what else happens in Iraq.
The second claim will be trickier to prove.
Bush and Blair must show that any weapons of mass destruction that are recovered posed a grave and urgent threat.
We know that Iraq at one time possessed chemical and biological weapons, because the US sold them to Iraq.
The test is not whether traces of those weapons remain, as such traces will be found at disposal sites, but whether those weapons were poised for use in threatening amounts.
If the Iraqis launch an attack with such weapons, this would demonstrate that the weapons were ready for use.
Whether they posed any real threat outside Iraq's borders, or would have been used in the absence of the current war, must still be assessed.
The third claim is hugely contentious.
Bush and Blair should demonstrate that the UN inspection process was failing.
This can be done by showing that the Iraqis were simply hiding the evidence at sites visited by the inspectors and declared free of weapons.
There should be a systematic review of sites that were visited.
There should also be an explanation, if weapons of mass destruction are uncovered at other sites, as to why the inspectors could not have found such weapons in a realistic period of time.
The fourth claim will be subject to wild propaganda on both sides.
Was the war justified in terms of costs and benefits, and was war really the last resort?
This will depend on an objective assessment of the costs of the war in terms of loss of life, destruction of property, economic impact within Iraq, spillovers into other forms of violence such as terrorism, and geopolitical consequences.
To date, Bush and Blair have failed to make the case to the world, with the partial exception of their own countries.
The American people have been treated to a spectacle of jingoism, fear mongering, confusion of Iraq with Osama bin Laden's terrorists, and simple patriotism.
None of this swayed the rest of the world, which views the war with disdain and alarm.
This would change if evidence on the four points is mustered.
When the 13 British colonies in North America launched their own War of Independence, Thomas Jefferson understood that "the decent respect to the opinions of mankind" required an explanation for that war, which he set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
Such an explanation, backed by rigorous evidence, is no less necessary today.
If the arguments for war are not proved, the consequences will be profound.
Propaganda, streets lined with cheering Iraqis, amazement over the prowess of US smart bombs, would not distract us from an awful truth-that Bush and Blair shattered world peace, engaged in massive premeditated killing, and did so against overwhelming global opinion.
Healing today's divided world could start only with fresh political leadership in both the US and UK, and a strong assertion of UN authority.
Given the terrible costs, I hope that this war will prove justified, though I have my doubts based on the current evidence.
If compelling evidence proves that weapons of mass destruction were at hand; that they were poised for use on a threatening scale; that the UN inspectors had poor prospects of uncovering and dismantling those weapons, then we must acknowledge the arguments made by Bush and Blair.
Even in those circumstances, war might well have been unwise compared to a policy of containment.
Still, the war would then at least make some sense.
The horrors of a senseless war are almost too frightening to contemplate.
PARIS – The world is witnessing a drastic decline of its natural capital.
Plant and animal species worldwide are vanishing at an unprecedented pace – 100 to 1,000 times the natural extinction rate.
The planet’s most endangered ecosystems are located in developing countries, and thus depend on some of the world’s neediest communities for their preservation.
Conversely, the poor are the first to suffer from deterioration of their natural environment.
But in the developing world, immediate economic needs often override long-term imperatives, and protecting a fragile environment is rarely a priority at the national level.
The biodiversity hosted by the world’s developing nations provides both local and global services.
Local, because the most fragile communities often rely for their survival on the biological resources that surround them, which constitute a precious source of food, energy and income.
The World Bank estimates that natural capital constitutes a quarter of total wealth in low-income countries, compared to 3% in the highly developed economies.
Global, because the array of services that natural ecosystems provide, such as clean air and fresh water, benefit people far beyond national borders.
Destruction of these precious natural environments generates international ills.
Consider climate change: few people realize that tropical forest destruction accounts for 20% of overall carbon emissions – more than the world’s cars, trucks, and airplanes combined.
Halting the cutting and burning of tropical forests, which are found almost exclusively in developing nations, is among the most readily achievable and effective possible steps to reduce carbon emissions.
On the grounds that the environment in developing countries provides unique ecological services to the whole of mankind, some argue that their populations should not exploit the natural resources on their territories.
But this would be ethically wrong, because developed nations have largely destroyed their own primary forests and ecosystems on the path to industrial development, and continue to import large quantities of raw material extracted in developing countries.
It would also be ineffective, because developing countries will – legitimately – refuse to assume by themselves the burden of protecting the world’s biodiversity to the detriment of their economic growth.
Thus, what is needed is a means to reconcile the task of helping some of the world’s poorest people with that of protecting irreplaceable ecosystems.
Addressing this two-fold challenge implies expanding the ability of local communities to manage the natural resources on which they depend.
The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), an international initiative launched eight years ago, is based on the principle that local communities themselves are the best trustees of the environment that surrounds them, and that their economic growth will advance their capacity to care for nature.
By focusing on “biodiversity hotspots” – regions with unique and highly threatened natural environments – the CEPF relies on the common-sense principle that protecting what nature provides for free is a crucial element of sustainable economic development.
The Fund, by delivering financial and technical assistance to people and places that need it the most, has helped create more than nine million hectares of new protected areas – a region larger than Portugal.
Such conservation-based development projects prove that economic growth and environmental protection are not incompatible.
On the contrary, mounting environmental challenges in some of the world’s economically deprived regions will not be overcome in a context of poverty.
Development agencies and environmentalists must thus urgently work toward the convergence of development and conservation priorities.
This is the kind of progress the world needs if it is to address effectively one of the most pressing issues of our time: providing a healthy, sustainable planet for rich and poor alike.
BERKELEY – At this stage in the worldwide fight against depression, it is useful to stop and consider just how conservative the policies implemented by the world’s central banks, treasuries, and government budget offices have been.
Almost everything that they have done – spending increases, tax cuts, bank recapitalization, purchases of risky assets, open-market operations, and other money-supply expansions – has followed a policy path that is nearly 200 years old, dating back to the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution, and thus to the  first stirrings of the business cycle.
The place to start is 1825, when panicked investors wanted their money invested in safe cash rather than risky enterprises.
Robert Banks Jenkinson, Second Earl of Liverpool and First Lord of the Treasury for King George IV, begged Cornelius Buller, Governor of the Bank of England, to act to prevent financial-asset prices from collapsing. “We believe in a market economy,” Lord Liverpool’s reasoning went, “but not when the prices a market economy produces lead to mass unemployment on the streets of London, Bristol, Liverpool, and Manchester.”
The Bank of England acted: it intervened in the market and bought bonds for cash, pushing up the prices of financial assets and expanding the money supply.
It loaned on little collateral to shaky banks. It announced its intention to stabilize the market – and that bearish speculators should beware.
Ever since, whenever governments largely stepped back and let financial markets work their way out of a panic out by themselves – 1873 and 1929 in the United States come to mind – things turned out badly.
But whenever government stepped in or deputized a private investment bank to support the market, things appear to have gone far less badly.
For example, the US government essentially authorized J.P. Morgan to act as the country’s central bank in the aftermath of the 1893 and 1907 panics, created the Resolution Trust Corporation at the start of the 1990’s, and, together with the IMF, intervened to support Mexico in 1995 and the East Asian economies in 1997-98.
At the very least, few modern governments are now willing to let financial market heal themselves.
To do so would be a truly radical step indeed.
The Obama administration and other central bankers and fiscal authorities around the globe are thus, in a sense, acting very conservatively, even as they embrace deficit-spending programs, boost the volume of government bonds, guarantee risky private debt, and buy up auto companies.
I understand what they are trying to do, and I am somewhat reluctant to second-guess them.  They are all doing their absolute best, and I know that if I were in any of their shoes I would be making bigger mistakes than they are – different mistakes, probably, but bigger ones for sure.
Nevertheless, I do have one big question.
The US government especially, but other governments as well, have gotten themselves deeply involved in industrial and financial policy during this crisis.
They have done this without constructing technocratic institutions like the 1930’s Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the 1990’s RTC, which played major roles in allowing earlier episodes of extraordinary government intervention into the industrial and financial guts of the economy to turn out relatively well, without an overwhelming degree of corruption and rent seeking.
The discretionary power of executives, in past crises, was curbed by new interventionist institutions constructed on the fly by legislative action.
That is how America’s founders, such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, envisioned that things would work.
They were suspicious of executive power, and thought that the president should have rather less discretionary power than the various King Georges of the time.
Yet, today’s crisis has not led to the establishment of such financial institutions.
So I wonder: why didn’t the US Congress follow the RFC/RTC model when authorizing George W. Bush’s and Barack Obama’s industrial and financial policies?
Why haven’t the technocratic institutions that we do have, like the IMF, been given a broader role in this crisis?
And what can we do to rebuild international financial-management institutions on the fly to make them the best possible?
SAN FRANCISCO &#45;&#45; John McCain, the likely Republican presidential nominee for president, likes to say that he was a “foot soldier” in the Reagan Revolution.
So was I, working out of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
But, unlike McCain, a good man and a true American hero, I don’t intend to vote Republican this November.
I am voting for Barack Obama.
Meritocracy is at the core of American conservative beliefs.
So let’s face it: George W. Bush has been the worst US president in memory.
His administration has been inept, corrupt, and without accomplishment.
After this performance, why give the Republicans another turn at the helm?
Let’s give the other party a chance, even if its policies are not exactly what conservatives may like.
In America, we call it “throwing the bums out.”
When meritocracy is downgraded, as it has been during the Bush years, bad things happen.
Worst of all, racism has flourished, because productivity and social utility have become less effective in protecting targets of discrimination.
Nowhere is this better illustrated than in America’s current debate over illegal immigration.
It is not so much the illegality of their entrance into the US that riles many conservative Republicans; it’s the migrants themselves, especially Hispanics who can’t speak English.
Never mind that Hispanic migrants are among the hardest-working people in the US.
It is a bitter irony that John McCain, the war hero, is considered a traitor by the conservative wing of his party because he has a compassionate attitude towards undocumented immigrants.
Sadly, the Republican Party has been hijacked during the Bush years by sloganeers using code phrases like “illegal immigration” and “protecting the middle class” to mask their racism, and “economic incentive effects” to justify tax policies that are blatantly tilted to the rich.
Responding to this politics of hate, Obama likes to call himself a “hope monger,” not a “hate monger.”
It’s a great line and it applies.
Hope always sells well in America.
Reagan understood that, and it is one of the reasons he was a great and beloved president, even if some of his policies were flawed.
As Hillary Clinton, Obama’s rapidly fading rival for the Democratic nomination is finding out to her dismay, policies can be an overrated commodity in presidential elections that really matter.
The hope that Obama is holding out for Americans is one of reconciliation – racial, political, between the wealthy and the poor, and between America and its allies.
This is powerful stuff, and dwarfs the narrow technocratic instincts of Mrs. Clinton, whose schoolgirl approach to the campaign has justly earned her defeat after defeat in the primaries.
Just as Reagan had his “Reagan Democrats” who were attracted by his message of hope after the malaise of the Jimmy Carter years, Obama will have his “Obama Republicans,” attracted by the hope of national reconciliation and healing.
Non-Americans must understand that there is yet another revolution brewing in the US, and that Senators Clinton and McCain are both likely to be swept away by it.
When conservative Republicans support liberal Democrats (Obama has been rated the most liberal member of the US Senate), “the times they are a-changin’,” as Bob Dylan wrote 45 years ago.
Moreover, a crucial difference today is that the generational conflict that so characterized the 1960’s – “Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,” as Dylan put it – is absent.
The young may be taking the lead – what Obama calls “a revolution from the bottom up” – but there is little opposition from today’s parents.
Indeed, I personally know a successful US hedge fund manager who is quite conservative and consistently votes Republican, but who is thinking of supporting Obama.
His daughter dates an African-American, and, to his credit, he believes in racial reconciliation.
True, an Obama victory would certainly increase his own taxes, but some things – for example, the promise of a multi-cultural America – are simply more important.
There appear to be many Republicans and independents who feel the same way.
Obama can lose these people, however, if he forgets that he is a reconciler, not a class warrior, and goes from tilting towards the poor to soaking the rich.
In any case, America’s allies should feel relieved by how the presidential election is shaping up.
America needs Obama, but McCain is a reasonable alternative.
He is no Bush, and conservative Republicans’ hatred of him is his badge of honor.
He would stand up to the haters at home (including those in his own party) and to the terrorists abroad.
That’s a lot better than what we have today.
LONDON – All intellectual systems rely on assumptions that do not need to be spelled out because all members of that particular intellectual community accept them.
These “deep” axioms are implicit in economics as well, but, if left unscrutinized, they can steer policymakers into a blind alley.
That is what is happening in today’s effort, in country after country, to slash spending and bring down budget deficits.
The chief task that John Maynard Keynes set himself in writing his General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money was to uncover the deep axioms underlying the economic orthodoxy of his day, which assumed away the possibility of persistent mass unemployment.
The question he asked of his opponents was: “What must they believe in order to claim that persistent mass unemployment is impossible, so that government ‘stimulus’ to raise the employment level could do no good?” In answering this question, Keynes reconstructed the orthodox theory – and then proceeded to demolish it.
Today, despite the Keynesian revolution, the same question demands an answer.
What do people who demand rapid “fiscal consolidation” amid heavy unemployment need to believe about the economy to make their policy coherent?
This question is not trivial, because the fiscal hair shirt has become the favored article of policy clothing among those who now dictate economic affairs.
Prestigious bodies like the G-20, the IMF, and the OECD join the “markets” and economic columnists in demanding that governments liquidate their deficits.
Any other course, they say, spells disaster; balancing budgets as soon as possible is the only way back to prosperity.
A few Keynesian economists stand against this stampede to retrenchment – Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Brad DeLong in the United States; Martin Wolf, Samuel Brittan, Danny Blanchflower, and I in the UK; and Paul de Grauwe and Jean-Paul Fitoussi in continental Europe.
But we are a small minority.
Indeed, all Western governments, with the exception of the Obama administration, are committed to retrenchment – and Obama cannot get a new stimulus package through Congress.
The question is: what must the cutters and slashers believe to justify their policies?
When I ask this question, I never get a coherent answer; so let me retrace Keynes’s steps.
The first of the implicit assumptions of orthodox theory that Keynes identified was Say’s Law, the doctrine that “supply creates its own demand.”
This means that all money earned is bound to be spent, and therefore that at no point in time could there be a “general glut” of commodities.
Keynes pointed out the fallacy here: while the income derived from production is, by definition, equal to the value of production, it does not follow that all this income will be spent.
Some part of it may be “hoarded,” in which case demand may fall short of supply.
Specifically, Keynes denied that saving is simply deferred spending.
In a well-known passage, he wrote: “An act of saving means…a decision not to have dinner today.
But it does not necessitate a decision to have dinner or to buy a pair of boots a week hence…Thus it depresses the business of preparing today’s dinner without stimulating the business of making ready for some future act of consumption.”
“Getting to that realization,” says Krugman, “was an awesome intellectual achievement.” Yet Say’s Law is alive and well among new classical macroeconomists like John Cochrane and Eugene Fama.
It amounts to claiming that the factors of production will always be fully employed, and that, in Cochrane’s words, “if the government borrows a dollar from you, that is a dollar that you do not spend, or that you do not lend to a company to spend on new investment.”
The second classical postulate Keynes identified was that the “real wage is equal to the marginal disutility of labor.”
This means that, in a competitive labor market, real wages will always be instantly adjusted to changes in conditions of demand.
In other words, there can never be involuntary, or unwanted, unemployment.
Keynes denied that real wages are set in the labor market.
Workers bargain for money wages, and a reduction in their money incomes might leave total demand too low to employ all those willing to work.
Yet today most economists model unemployment as “voluntary” – a rational preference for leisure rather than work.
This reinforces the idea that “stimulus” cannot do any good, since workers have as much employment as they want.
Keynes thought that the chief implicit assumption underlying the classical theory of the economy was that of perfect knowledge. “Risks,” he wrote, “were supposed to be capable of an exact actuarial computation.
The calculus of probability…was supposed to be capable of reducing uncertainty to the same calculable status as certainty itself…”
For Keynes, this is untenable: “Actually…we have as a rule only the vaguest idea of any but the most direct consequences of our acts.” This made investment, which is always a bet on the future, dependent on fluctuating states of confidence.
Financial markets, through which investment is made, were always liable to collapse when something happened to disturb business confidence.
Therefore, market economies were inherently unstable.
Today’s “efficient market theory” restored to economics the assumption of perfect knowledge by claiming that all risks are correctly priced.
This means that the “underpricing of risk worldwide,” which Alan Greenspan identified as the root cause of the banking collapse of 2007-08, is impossible.
Yet it happened.
The classical view of the economy, which Keynes set out to demolish, is not only alive, but in recent years has been dominant, feeding the belief that competitive markets can be left to regulate themselves, will always provide as much employment as is wanted, and are immune to large-scale collapse.
This also fuels opposition to government intervention, and to “stimulus” policies, which are supposedly redundant, if not harmful, since the events that require them cannot happen (but do).
Unless we start discussing economics in a Keynesian framework, we are doomed to a succession of crises and recessions.
If we don’t, the next one will come sooner than we think.
A cynic might be tempted to say that when politicians run out of ideas, they turn to making or changing the constitution.
Take the European Union.
Its last big project was the single market as conceived by Jacques Delors, the European Commission's then-President.
That project has still not been completed, but the missing bits are a continuing process, not a new idea.
Since then, the EU has tried a little of this and a little of that: a little common economic policy around the introduction of the Euro, a little common foreign policy around the Iraq war.
None of it has been very successful.
Indeed, none of it has an advocate of the stature of Delors.
So the EU turned to constitution making.
It set up a Convention, which produced a draft treaty, and soon an Intergovernmental Conference will try to take the project to a conclusion.
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany liked the idea so much that he is now thinking of setting up his own Convention to review Germany's constitutional arrangements.
His target-agreed with the other main parties-is the precarious relationship between Federal authority (notably the power of the purse) and that of the Länder and local governments.
Perhaps the German Chancellor hopes that in the shadows of such an all-party Convention he can quietly slip through "reforms" that are, for the most part, really cuts in public expenditure for social services.
The case of Prime Minister Tony Blair of the UK is even more extreme.
The inventor of New Labour would like to be remembered as the man who squared the circle of sustainable economic growth and a reformed welfare state, the man who reconciled wealth creation and social cohesion.
But the British economy is in a precarious state, and public services remain a mess.
What has changed under New Labour's rule is the British constitution.
Scotland has a parliament, Wales an assembly.
English regions may soon follow.
London and other cities have directly elected mayors.
Ancient institutions, notably the House of Lords, have been "modernized."
The judicial system has seen root and branch change.
In fact, Blair is reportedly not very interested in these changes, but it is they-not some beacon of British prosperity and social justice-that are his lasting legacy.
Other European leaders could be added to the list, not least Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy.
In all these cases, the cynic would be half-right.
Constitutional change is for political leaders a welcome distraction from the much more change-resistant issues of social policy.
But there are at least two exceptions to this suspicion.
One is the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in countries that have recently emerged from dictatorship.
The process requires constitution making of an often complex and painful kind.
The most recent example is Turkey, where a courageous prime minister has confirmed the secular (rather than Islamist) rule of law, sought to modernize the economy, and has kept the military out of the Cabinet.
Turkey wants desperately to be accepted into the EU, whose "Copenhagen criteria," approved in 1993, define what may be called the constitutional prerequisites of membership.
The accession countries of East Central Europe all fulfilled the criteria; Turkey is now following their example.
The other serious issue of a constitutional nature is that of levels of government.
In a globalized world environment, the question of who is responsible for what has become as opaque-if not unanswerable-as it is urgent.
This is all the more true in view of the fact that the migration of decisions to an ill-defined global space is being accompanied by a widespread demand for more direct forms of democracy that can bring decisions closer to people, regions, and local communities.
There are as yet no "Copenhagen criteria" to guide constitution-makers here.
Britain is a good example of the confusions that attend mere pragmatism.
Scotland may have a new (and expensive) government, but what about the English regions?
Are the East Midlands really an appropriate unit of self-government?
In Germany the issue is the distribution of tax revenue.
Central government can easily starve the regions and local communities of their lifeblood.
Who is to prevent it from doing so?
In France and Spain there are small but effective (and sometimes violent) regional movements.
Should the rest of the country simply give in to them?
Where lies the right answer between a Scottish solution and a Chechen non-solution?
The point of asking such questions is to remind ourselves that genuine constitutional politics requires serious thought and careful preparation.
It must never be a substitute for the absence of other ideas.
In that sense, Conventions such as the one led by former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing for Europe are a good idea.
They just might dissuade politicians who are bereft of ideas from indulging in pet projects that lead nowhere.
Today’s ongoing financial market turmoil comes as no surprise to those who have been warning about the risks to the world economy from the end of the housing market bubble in the United States.
Back in January, the United Nations’ outlook for the global economy raised concerns about the economic pain this might impose on heavily indebted US households.
It also emphasized how weakly regulated, closely interconnected global financial markets, together with persistent global macroeconomic imbalances, jeopardize growth and development prospects in the world economy, including poorer countries.
The US current account deficit has been the most widely discussed indicator of global imbalances.
For the past five years, the US has been sucking in more than $2 billion a day of other countries’ savings, as the easy provision of domestic credit on an unprecedented scale has allowed households to spend more than they earn.
Such borrowing was especially attractive as asset (housing and equity) prices kept rising, interest rates remained low, and succeeding generations of financial market innovators could convince investors that they had mastered the exigencies of risk.
Thus, further lending, even against over-valued collateral, was “sold” as a sign of good times ahead.
Warnings about irrational market exuberance were largely ignored, especially as US consumer spending helped fuel strong growth across the global economy.
Robust exports from Japan and Europe supported economic recovery and steadied investor confidence, providing, in turn, further export opportunities for newly industrializing countries, most notably China.
Meanwhile, heightened international competition kept the lid on inflation, and interest rates remained low, giving a further boost to consumer spending and completing what looked like a virtuous growth circle.
Even many of the poorest countries seemed, at long last, to be joining in, posting strong growth on the back of rising energy and raw material prices, renewed mining investments from abroad, and increasing fiscal revenues.
Although the numbers were never as rosy as market enthusiasts seemed to think, they did divert attention away from the shaky foundations of the newfound prosperity.
The growing need for measures to correct global imbalances was met with disbelief by influential policymakers and market analysts alike: “Why change a winning formula?”
The fate of the rest of the world depends on the responses to the unfolding financial turmoil.
The contraction of property and stock markets will undoubtedly dampen US household borrowing and demand, potentially triggering a downward spiral.
If protection is sought through tariff and other trade-related measures, then the knock-on effects could have even more devastating consequences for all.
In recent weeks, leading central bankers have injected over $300 billion into the financial system, lowered the rates at which they lend to private banks, and announced that such activism will continue until calm returns.
This may be enough to calm financial markets for now, but it will not redress the more fundamental problems behind the current turmoil.
In today’s interdependent world, a coordinated strategy is needed to avoid recession and to return lasting stability to financial markets.
Indeed, the fact that the world is again worrying about the economic fallout from financial shocks highlights the lack of progress since the Asian crisis a decade ago in moving towards a new international financial architecture.
While there has been some progress on harmonizing standards and extending surveillance, there has been far too much emphasis on strengthening governance in developing countries and not enough on systemic problems linked to unregulated private capital flows.
With the imminent threat of global recession, austerity measures are not the way to correct global imbalances.
Rather, deficit countries need to export their way back to balance, while imports should increase in surplus countries.
Moreover, productive investments are needed in the poorest countries to resume or sustain economic development.
Policymakers need the fiscal and monetary space to move in this direction.
Institutionalizing a mechanism for broad-based international economic surveillance and policy coordination will be an important longer-term goal, but at this point, world leaders urgently need to rebalance global demand and improve the management of the exchange-rate system.
Moving forward requires all governments to act through inclusive multilateral organizations and arrangements.
Despite the IMF’s undemocratic and corporate-like governance, which has undermined its legitimacy and credibility in the developing world and distorted efforts to extend its surveillance role, there is no alternative multilateral body available.
Such a coordinated response will need to address immediate short-term problems as well as provide medium-term solutions without plunging the world economy into another painful recession.
And it is imperative that this time around, reforms offer a lasting solution to global imbalances and tackle head on the most unruly elements of international financial capital.
America and the world are focused on whether the Bush administration will adopt the Iraq Study Group’s recommendations for an exit strategy from Iraq.
That is the most pressing immediate question, but America’s leaders should also be thinking ahead.
America needs a post-occupation strategy for Iraq and the Middle East, one grounded in a viable national security strategy for the twenty-first century.
That strategy is containment.
In the run-up to the Iraq invasion, the Bush administration rejected containment as an obsolete Cold War hangover.
The weapons inspectors were pulled out, and America opted for preemptive war.
Bush was portrayed as facing down a new Hitler with Churchillian resolve, and advocates of containment were accused of appeasement.
But now we know that the containment regime worked.
Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was in no position to threaten anyone, let alone the United States.
This was not the first time that containment – a strategy devised by George Kennan, the director of the US State Department’s Policy Planning Staff under President Harry Truman, in response to the Soviet threat after World War II – has been rejected as appeasement.
In the 1952 presidential election campaign, Dwight Eisenhower and his future secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, heaped scorn on containment, calling instead for a “rollback” of the Soviets in Eastern Europe.
Fortunately, once in office, the Eisenhower administration had the sense to stick with containment in Europe, continuing a policy that is widely credited for winning the Cold War.
President John F. Kennedy’s insistence, against much advice, on containment during the Cuban missile crisis saved the world from nuclear war.
This was calculated resolve, not appeasement.
Containment’s goal was to prevent Soviet expansion without saddling the US with unsustainable military obligations.
So long as the USSR did not stage a military attack, containment’s reliance on economic sticks and carrots, competition within the world communist movement, intelligence and diplomacy, and promoting the vitality of the capitalist democracies would guarantee security.
Kennan was right: the dysfunctional features of Soviet system, and its over-extension internationally, would lead to its demise.
When containment has been abandoned, America has paid a high price.
The Eisenhower administration toppled Iran’s elected government in 1953 believing it to be too pro-Soviet.
The hugely unpopular Shah they installed was swept away in the Islamic revolution in 1979.
America made comparable errors in Guatemala and elsewhere in Latin America.
Vietnam was America’s costliest departure from containment.
As Kennan explained, when America goes to war over something less than a vital interest, the adversary – for whom vital interests are at stake – will fight long after the war has become too unpopular at home to sustain.
Bush repeated this mistake in Iraq.
Containment is hardly a relic of the Cold War.
It worked against Libya, leading Muammar Khadafi in the late 1990’s to stop sponsoring terrorism, turn over the Lockerbie bombers for trial, and pay compensation to British and French victims of Libyan-sponsored terrorism.
Claims that he abandoned his nuclear program in response to the US-led invasion of Iraq have been refuted by Flynt Leverett, director for Middle Eastern affairs at the US National Security Council from 2002 to 2003.
According to Leverett, Khadafi’s decision predated the invasion and was a response to an explicit quid-pro-quo to end international sanctions against Libya.
Containment against Libya was not appeasement.
It should have been the model in Iraq, as it now should be the model in Iran.
Instead, defenders of the contemporary equivalent of “rollback” advocate attacking Iran because it is developing nuclear weapons.
This makes about as much sense as it would to attack China in the 1950’s.
One of Kennan’s great insights was that the US is well served by conflict among America’s adversaries.
He welcomed Tito’s rise in Yugoslavia as an internal challenge to Moscow’s hegemony that he hoped others would emulate.
This lesson is lost on the Bush administration, which senselessly alienated Iran in 2002, when moderates had the upper hand there and were cooperating in Afghanistan, and reversed decades of US policy by insisting that any Middle East settlement must accept changed “realities on the ground” in the West Bank.
The administration seems bent on herding adversaries together – transforming Samuel Huntington’s “clash-of-civilizations” dystopia into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Kennan maintained that the US should work to create a world that no one can dominate, and that the best way to spread democracy is to demonstrate its superiority.
Ramming democracy down people’s throats is self-defeating.
Just as it produced a potent fusion of communism and anti-American nationalism in Southeast Asia and Latin America, it is now producing a similar combination of radical Islam and anti-American nationalism across the Middle East.
Terrorist groups can be minimized if their enabling states are contained.
Defenders of the Bush doctrine claim that this is impossible when they operate out of failed states that cannot police their borders.
But, given that the Bush doctrine has compounded the failed-state problem, this is a bogus argument.
However many failed states there were in the world before America invaded Iraq, there is one more now.
To build a containment regime against terrorism emanating from the Middle East, a date for America’s departure from Iraq must be set.
There is no other way to reverse the widespread perception across the region that the US has imperial ambitions.
The other essential step is to place resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict at the center of America’s foreign policy agenda.
America must push for a solution that can garner the support of significant majorities of all the peoples between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean.
That is the surest means of protecting and promoting democracy.
An Arab-Israeli peace requires a comprehensive approach, because the problems at stake are intertwined.
Not only are key issues such as Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees insoluble without an all-Arab consensus, but any country that is left out of the peace process is bound to persist in its role as a revolutionary power bent on regional destabilization.
Admittedly, Israeli governments have never liked the idea of negotiating peace with all enemies simultaneously, if only because the political costs of the required concessions would be unbearable.
The Israeli strategy of peacemaking therefore oscillates between two visions: while the Israeli left gives priority to the Palestinian problem, the Israeli right prefers pursuing a settlement with the big Arab powers.
The current Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the American veto on negotiations with Syria indicate that we have returned to the “Palestine first” concept.
But the prospects of success are desperately dim.
With the Americans still refraining from engaging in a Clinton-like level of committed mediation, the parties look to be incapable of meeting each other’s minimal requirements for a settlement.
Their failure would have dire consequences for the entire region.
The Syria-Iran-Hamas-Hezbollah axis would be emboldened in its challenge to American leadership in the region, and, with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas humbled and defeated, a third Intifada would be a likely scenario.
It is therefore vitally important to take Syria, an ally of Iran and the patron of spoilers such as Hamas and Hezbollah, out of the war equation.
But this requires that both Israel and the United States change course.
Syria has a keen interest in being invited into an US-led settlement with Israel.
The muted response of the Arab states to Israel’s recent mysterious air raid on its territory reflects its isolation within the Arab world – an isolation with which the Syrians are extremely uncomfortable.
The Ba’athist regime in Damascus is marked by two major formative experiences: Hafez al-Assad’s loss of the Golan Heights to Israel, and his son Bashar’s loss of Lebanon.
Recovering the Golan, gaining recognition of Syria’s special interests in Lebanon, and reconciling with America are thus vital objectives for the regime and the best way that Bashar al-Assad can boost his legitimacy at home.
Syria’s readmission into the Arab consensus and financial support from the Gulf monarchies for abandoning the Shi’a alliance with Iran and Hezbollah would also be significant gains.
Bashar may lack his father’s acumen, but he, too, knows a simple truth: peace with Israel is the price to pay.
The question remains whether Bashar understands that peace is not only about regaining the Golan, but also about normalization of relations with Israel, which his father was reluctant to allow.
The old Assad feared that open borders and the end of the politics of conflict might erode his one-party system.
Peace thus requires a degree of political and socioeconomic change to diminish the appetite for military adventurism.
A Damascene conversion is not only possible, but is also vital for regional peace.
The most realistic scenario is now a three-front war pitting Israel against Syria, Hamas, and Hezbollah.
But a Syrian-Israeli peace would drive a wedge between Syria and Iran, thereby cutting off Hezbollah’s lines of arms supply while allowing the vital task of stabilizing Lebanon to succeed.
The only way to extricate Syria from the fatal Iranian embrace is to draw it into a regional scheme for peace.
Alas, precisely because of their isolation and the Ba’athist regime’s paranoiac nature, the Syrians are unlikely to meet the US condition for peace talks: abandoning their current rogue alliances and their marriage with terror.
But a Damascene conversion can only be the outcome of negotiations, not a prerequisite for them.
The idea that the Arab-Israeli peace process requires choosing between a Syrian or a Palestinian track has proved to be a dangerous fallacy.
Neither the Palestinians nor the Syrians will acquiesce to their exclusion.
A revolutionary force in international relations is one whose level of dissatisfaction with the status quo is such that it works to undermine it at any price.
In addition to reviewing the state of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, the November Middle East conference that President George W. Bush has called should begin to build a platform for an Israeli-Syrian negotiating track and a region-wide forum where clear rules of conduct and engagement are agreed by all.
Of course, this conference will not bring an end to the Damascus-Tehran axis.
But if the US exercises a brand of statesmanship different from the one that has so far put it on the defensive on almost every front, it could start to eat away at the foundations of that axis.
One year after the Indian Ocean tsunami, what are the lessons?
The biggest one is that it was the type of disaster to which policymakers pay too little attention – one that has a very low or unknown probability of occurring, but that creates enormous losses if it does occur.
Great as the death toll, physical and emotional suffering of survivors, and property damage caused by the tsunami were, even greater losses could be inflicted by other disasters of low (but not negligible), or unknown, probability.
For example, the asteroid that exploded above Siberia in 1908 with the force of a hydrogen bomb might have killed millions of people had it exploded above a major city.
Yet that asteroid was only about 200 feet in diameter.
A much larger one (among the thousands of dangerously large asteroids in orbits that intersect the earth’s) could strike the earth and cause the total extinction of the human race through a combination of shock waves, fire, tsunamis, and blockage of sunlight, wherever it struck.
Other catastrophic risks include natural epidemics (the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza killed between 20 million and 40 million people), nuclear or biological attacks by terrorists, certain types of lab accidents, and abrupt global warming.
The probability of catastrophes, whether intentional or not, resulting from human activity appears to be increasing because of the rapidity and direction of technological advances.
The fact that a catastrophe is unlikely to occur is not a rational justification for ignoring the risk of its occurrence.
Suppose that a tsunami as destructive as the one in the Indian Ocean last year occurs on average once a century and kills 250,000 people.
That is an average of 2,500 deaths per year.
If such a toll could be substantially reduced at moderate cost, the investment would be worthwhile.
Educating residents of low-lying coastal areas about the warning signs of a tsunami (tremors and a sudden recession in the ocean), establishing a warning system involving emergency broadcasts, telephoned warnings, and air-raid-type sirens, and improving emergency response systems would have saved many who were killed by the Indian Ocean tsunami.
At the same time, the cost would have been well below any reasonable estimate of the average losses that can be expected from tsunamis.
There are several reasons why such measures weren’t taken in anticipation of a tsunami on the scale that occurred.
First, although a once-in-a-century event is as likely to occur at the beginning of the century as at any other time, it is much less likely to occur in the first decade of the century than later.
Politicians with limited terms of office and thus foreshortened political horizons are likely to discount low-risk disaster possibilities, since the risk of damage to their careers from failing to take precautionary measures is truncated.
Second, to the extent that effective precautions require governmental action, the fact that government is a centralized system of control makes it difficult for officials to respond to the full spectrum of possible risks against which cost-justified measures might be taken.
Given the variety of matters to which they must attend, officials are likely to have a high threshold of attention below which risks are ignored.
Third, where risks are regional or global rather than local, many national governments, especially in poorer and smaller countries, may drag their heels in the hope that larger and richer countries will bear the costs of addressing them.
Knowing this, larger and richer countries may be reluctant to take precautionary measures, as this would reward and thus encourage “free riding.”
Fourth, countries are poor often because of weak, inefficient, or corrupt government, characteristics that may disable them from taking cost-justified precautions.
And the difficulty people everywhere have in thinking in terms of probabilities – especially low probabilities, which they tend to write off – weakens political support for incurring the costs of taking precautionary measures.
An even more dramatic example of neglect of low-probability/high-cost risks is the danger of an asteroid strike, which is analytically similar to the menace of tsunamis.
Indeed, in part because tsunamis are one of the risks of an asteroid collision, the Indian Ocean disaster has stimulated new interest in asteroid defense.
Deflecting an asteroid from its orbit when it is still hundreds of millions of miles from Earth is a feasible undertaking.
Nevertheless, in the United States, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spends only $4 million of its annual budget of more than $10 billion on mapping dangerously close large asteroids.
At the current rate, NASA may not complete the task for another decade, even though such mapping is the key to an asteroid defense because it may give us years of warning.
The fact that a disaster of a particular type has not occurred recently or even within human memory (or even ever) is a bad reason to ignore it.
The risk may be slight, but if the consequences should it materialize are great enough, the expected cost of disaster may be sufficient to warrant defensive measures.
Capitalism will not take root around the world if corruption defiles it.
Socialism collapsed a decade ago because it became discredited in the eyes of the peoples who lived under it.
Now capitalism is receiving severe rebukes, with its critics given powerful evidence that they are right in seeing it as a system that works for insiders and their cronies.
After all, isn't Enron's bankruptcy a crystal-clear example of inmates controlling their guards?
If America wants to lead capitalism's global march, it must exorcize a growing culture of corporate crony capitalism.
The choice, of course, is no longer between socialism and capitalism.
Socialism became a mess as great expectations of a workers' paradise were bogged down in bureaucracy.
Without incentives and radical decentralization, economic progress is simply a dream.
So the past century demonstrated time and again, which is why China - nostalgic egalitarian rhetoric notwithstanding - opted for all-out capitalism under its post-Mao rulers.
Did Deng Xiao Peng foresee the vast inequalities that would result?
Possibly.
But Deng wanted higher standards of living for every Chinese, even if inequality resulted.
To function and remain socially acceptable, however, capitalism must be as clean as possible.
Everybody may not get a chance to become rich in a capitalist system, but the system should not be perceived as rigged in ways that allow only insiders to get rich while everyone else pays the bill.
If inequality is one negative aspect of radical capitalism - to some extent mitigated by the public sector - the other one is the potential corruption of capitalist institutions: call it the Enron syndrome.
When American Congressional committees weaken regulatory oversight of their business friends; when accounting firms surrender their independence because of the lure of mega-contracts; when corporate boards can't say no because the fees of board members are stunningly large relative to the effort; and when managers live in a frenzy of self-dealing, the stage is set for capitalism to lose its reputation.
That clearly is the case of late in America.
Capitalism involves a delicate problem of agency and trust; giving managers the green light for entrepreneurship is not enough to make certain that the interests of investors are safeguarded; nor is it enough for stock markets to price securities realistically.
While evidence about the Enron debacle is not fully in, it is fair to say that Enron is both a great moral scandal and a blot on capitalism. It throws a stark light on the flaws of capitalism's core institutions.
The witch-hunt underway - with politicians, regulators, and even the White House seeking to save their political skins - is, indeed, essential.
Inevitably, it contains populist, anti-business sentiments.
At times, it almost looks as if anti-globalization protesters are taking over.
But in the swing of the pendulum the excesses of yesterday will incite greater scrutiny and a tougher rulebook for business in the future.
All for the good.
Capitalism is a public trust; it works if everybody has a fair chance and corporate theft receives highly visible punishments.
The ritual witch-hunt now underway may be the only way for bosses to regain their bearings.
For the only way capitalism can be made acceptable, and hence deliver growth and prosperity around the world, is to practice this rite of exorcism in public.
Enron bosses will be humiliated; other bosses will (in private) shake their heads at the scale of these purges.
They will argue that all the Congressional and newspaper investigations are excessive; that we should put Enron behind us and move on to the business of making money again.
But to act in such a way will leave those doubtful of capitalism in even greater doubt.
Such, indeed, would create the ultimate moral hazard - a world of corporate crime without punishment.
Some will say that it will be impossible to build good boards of directors if members can be sued; some will ponder what will happen to stocks if hard questions are asked about financial reporting by companies.
A clean sweep, however, will ultimately be good for stocks and certainly much better than cover-up and lingering doubts about what the books really look like.
Capitalism, indeed, has always needed its morality tales.
But distinctions must be made.
The failure of Long Term Capital Management a few years ago provided a lesson about risk management and the need to not be dreamy-eyed about a string of huge returns.
Nothing remotely illegal happened then; there was no government bailout nor facilitation of management's errors.
Investors simply made a mistake out of greed and lost, big time.
By contrast the Enron affair involved impropriety and perhaps criminal conduct of just about anyone coming close to management.
Moreover, it is not yet clear whether or not top Enron managers won't walk away with a bundle of cash while the company's workers lose their retirement assets.
Chinese capitalism, too, is rife with corruption and self-dealing.
I will throw you away very fast.
