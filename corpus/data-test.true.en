though Ayatollah Khomeini ’ s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel ’ s old alliance with Iran , the two countries continued to conduct business with America ’ s blessing .
the Iran-Contra affair of the 1980 ’ s , through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point .
Israel and Iran , two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment , shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change .
it was during Yitzhak Rabin ’ s government in the early 1990 ’ s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict , owing to the changing strategic environment after America ’ s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union .
the US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process , which produced a series of breathtaking achievements – the Madrid peace conference , the Oslo accords , Israel ’ s peace agreement with Jordan , a near-rapprochement with Syria , and Israel ’ s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar – was an increasingly isolated Iran ’ s worst nightmare .
it was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran , two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East , chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms .
the conflict was now between Israel , a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire , and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians .
more an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such , the Mullahs ’ resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish , pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran ’ s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses .
in an Arab Middle East , Iran is the natural enemy ; in an Islamic world , Iran is a potential leader .
ironically , Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy , for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , Hamas in Palestine , and the Shiite majority in Iraq .
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran , but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching .
as an anti-status quo power , Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel , but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order .
but Israel has every reason to be concerned , for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge – the core rationale of Israel ’ s own strategy of “ nuclear ambiguity ” – and would embolden its enemies throughout the region .
it would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation , with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way .
a military attack on Iran ’ s nuclear facilities is too dangerous , and its results uncertain .
and , however severe economic sanctions might be , they might not bring Iran to its knees .
nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon .
however , being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational , and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism .
in the American-Iranian equation it was the US , not Iran , that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy .
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War , but was left out of the Madrid peace conference .
Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan .
and , when US forces overran Saddam Hussein ’ s army in the spring of 2003 , the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table , from the nuclear issue to Israel , from Hezbollah to Hamas .
the Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process .
but , neo-conservative haughtiness – “ We don ’ t speak to evil ” – ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran ’ s demarche .
Iran ’ s mood changed by the time America ’ s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift , but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse .
this would not be achieved , however , through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime , or by America ’ s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran ’ s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race .
Iran ’ s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures , which are far lower than those of its enemies , but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power .
there is no better way to undercut Iran ’ s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace , accompanied by massive investments in human development , and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East , including Israel .
Cambridge – Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand , I find today ’ s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious .
do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments ’ latest “ comprehensive package ” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months ?
the new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding .
even the best part of the plan , the proposed ( but not really agreed ) 50 % haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt , is not sufficient to stabilize that country ’ s profound debt and growth problems .
so how is it that the euro is trading at a 40 % premium to the US dollar , even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism ?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall , and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate .
let ’ s begin with why the euro needs to fall .
absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union , which can lead only through constitutional change , the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable .
it seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign ( junk ) bonds .
that may work in the short term , but if sovereign default risks materialize – as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely – the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized .
and , if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer – and political resistance runs high – the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation .
either way , the threat of a profound financial crisis is high .
given this , what arguments support the current value of the euro , or its further rise ?
first , investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario , the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries , creating a super-euro .
but , while this scenario has a certain ring of truth , surely any breakup would be highly traumatic , with the euro diving before its rump form recovered .
second , investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic , the consequences radiated so widely that , paradoxically , the dollar actually rose in value .
although it may be difficult to connect the dots , it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere .
perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks , many of which remain vulnerable , owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value .
third , foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies .
government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors .
if foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro ’ s strength , the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee , just as private investors would , only in a faster and more concentrated way .
fourth , investors may believe that , ultimately , US risks are just as large as Europe ’ s .
true , the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits .
whereas the US Congress ’ s “ supercommittee , ” charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package , will likely come up with a proposal , it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year .
Moreover , investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of “ quantitative easing , ” which would further drive down the dollar .
fifth , the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis . &amp; # 160 ; An exchange rate of $ 1.4 : € 1 is cheap for Germany ’ s export powerhouse , which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro .
for the eurozone ’ s southern periphery , however , today ’ s euro rate is very difficult to manage .
whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis , wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards , even as productivity has remained stagnant .
but , because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone ’ s north and south , one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range .
finally , investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders ’ latest plan will work , even though the last dozen plans have failed .
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “ You can fool some of the people all of the time , and all of the people some of the time , but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time . ” A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time , but not for all of the countries anytime soon .
so , yes , there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro , despite its drawn-out crisis , has remained so firm against the dollar so far .
but don ’ t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead .
BUENOS Aires – desperate times bring desperate measures .
the latest package to cope with Greece ’ s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country ’ s debt burden .
in essence , this is a back-door debt restructuring : Europe ’ s bailout fund , the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts , thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default .
a recurrent characteristic of Europe ’ s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent .
indeed , many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980 ’ s .
Bolivia ’ s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt , an operation funded by international donors , is a classic example .
but the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case : Ecuador in 2008 .
President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign ( debt repudiation was part of his platform ) , and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch .
the reasons invoked by Correa ( legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange ) were beside the point .
the default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets , only to buy them back at a discount through the back door .
that task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico , which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above – a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off “ vulture ” investors .
to speed things up , after the default was declared in December 2008 , Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders , to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned .
with the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands , and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff , the operation was a success .
this episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks .
the first concerns the market response .
Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields , it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador ’ s behavior : Ecuador , an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices , could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange .
this is particularly notable , given that Ecuador ’ s was perhaps the first opportunistic default ( triggered by unwillingness , rather than inability , to pay ) in recent history .
the second lesson , and the one most pertinent to Europe now , concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario .
indeed , almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount .
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a “ credit event ” in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices .
the premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement ( that is , that private bondholders take a real hit ) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005 .
in Uruguay , what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief ; in Argentina , a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50 % .
so the question arises : how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort ?
if Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt , the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out .
only the probability of a default – and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts – can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount .
but the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring .
in other words , a successful buyback is a preamble to default .
can Greece , with the EFSF ’ s help , obtain debt relief while avoiding default ?
small purchases at current panic prices , vulture-fund style , are always possible , but they do not promise substantial debt relief .
large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market , defeating the point of the whole operation .
and the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe , both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced .
but what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way , say , by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market ?
naturally , the spread would automatically converge to the threshold , but how much would be sold ?
would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders ?
if the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount , the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal .
after all , by capping spreads , the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside – a good reason , perhaps , to make the facility a temporary offer .
by contrast , if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels , purchases will be more substantive , but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders .
a debt buyback is something of a catch 22 : to succeed in inducing a haircut , it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate .
without Ecuador ’ s gimmicks , buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece ’ s debt overhang .
Atlanta &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza , where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea , air , or land . an entire population is being brutally punished .
this gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel , with United States backing , after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006 .
the election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers .
Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now , after internal strife , Hamas alone controls Gaza . Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel , plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet .
regardless of one ’ s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine , we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water , food , electricity , and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza , about one million of whom are refugees .
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area , causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children .
prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week , this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B ’ Tselem , the leading Israeli human rights organization : 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3 .
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn &apos;t take part in the fighting , and 25 were under 18 years of age .
on a recent trip through the Middle East , I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis .
one of my visits was to Sderot , a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza .
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism , since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants .
subsequently , I met with leaders of Hamas , both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus , Syria .
I made the same condemnation to them , and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period .
they responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated , and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank , which Israel had refused .
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza , which the Israelis considered and also rejected .
there are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land .
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank , which is approximately one-fourth ( 28.5 % ) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community .
some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River , and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for “ security . ”
all Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions .
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people .
this holds promise of progress , but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis , Maryland , a retrogression has occurred in the process .
nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine , the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased , and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened .
it is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations , but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly .
it is time for strong voices in Europe , the US , Israel , and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people .
OSAKA – Yesterday ’ s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955 .
for most of the last decade , the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP , although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system .
Twenty years after the Cold War ’ s end , Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government .
the Japanese public , even now , remains uncertain about the DPJ ’ s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution , which lack solid funding .
the public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic , coherent foreign and security policy
yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP .
for the last four years , the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern : pensions , unemployment , and the fraying social safety net .
Moreover , the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling .
the LDP ’ s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party ’ s power nucleus had melted down .
once in power , the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins , which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests .
indeed , immediately after the election , the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due .
the figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process , in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP .
so , without breaking the regular budget cycle , the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP , but will also be stuck with next year ’ s budget , which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced .
as a result , the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP ’ s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch . it will also revise the supplementary budget as well .
but time is short , and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen .
to gain control of the mandarins , the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries ’ top leadership , as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister .
unfortunately , the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill , which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees .
the DPJ , despite its manifesto , seems unprepared to tame the mandarins , and so may be forced to rely on them .
the ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan ’ s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period .
unlike in Europe , Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society .
indeed , full-fledged “ society ” -building started only after the 1868 Meiji restoration , which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state .
as a result , the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged , and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well .
they will most likely succeed .
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills , LDP lawmakers checked the bills , and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the diet ( parliament ) .
since the LDP , recently with a coalition partner , controlled the diet , the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins , centered in the LDP ’ s headquarters .
the diet ’ s role was merely pro forma .
indeed , under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system , this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan ’ s government polity .
the DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins , partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers .
the mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard , owing partly to the tax system , which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions , especially think tanks , where independent policy expertise can be forged .
Moreover , perhaps in anticipation of a change in power , the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries ’ top administrative positions .
and what of the LDP ?
having fallen from power , it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds .
unable to pay off its constituencies , disintegration looms , for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support , but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a Web of insiders across the country ’ s industrial sectors , occupational associations , and local communities .
only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible .
the DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support , so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies , such as labor unions and other interest groups .
the birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point .
a major power shift in favor of “ society ” has taken place .
if the DPJ can break free of mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister , as it intends , Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role .
Yerevan – Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan ’ s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic .
given the two countries ’ long-strained relations , this visit would have been remarkable at any time .
but coming as it does only one month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation , it may offer real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased .
of course , ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey .
but now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns .
in the new context set by the war in Georgia , the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone .
this expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey ’ s geography and history .
situated figuratively between modernity and tradition , secularism and Islam , and democracy and tyranny , Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West .
for the peoples of the Caucasus , Turkey marks our path to Europe .
it is a NATO member , bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs .
it aspires to join the European Union , and would bring the EU to our three borders , even as we , too , aspire to join one day .
indeed , Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker .
immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union , Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation .
this year , as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter , Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel .
now , in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis , Turkey ’ s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus .
the world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts .
but , in order to succeed , Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region ’ s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes .
if this pledge is adopted and respected , conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different , more tolerant context , marking a historic breakthrough to peace .
in fact , why not take the idea of such a pact one step further ?
we in this region can , and I believe should , call for a non-aligned Caucasus , free of security blocs and adversarial alliances .
after all , security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines , with their attendant security challenges .
our countries and peoples have , throughout history , lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided .
today , we share a common vision of European integration , and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned .
only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region ’ s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance .
but , at the end of the day , we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation .
the Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts .
although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral , the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world , and certainly not in this interconnected region .
in fact , real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations .
one is a lesson from history : Russia ’ s strategic interests here cannot be ignored .
to believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos .
the other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever .
there must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region .
ironically , both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest .
the Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia ’ s strategic role in the region .
the US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia ’ s real and imagined reliance on Russia .
beyond the emotional impact of President Gul ’ s visit to Yerevan , real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries ’ closed border – the last in Europe .
or , for a start , the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational .
if this does not happen within the coming weeks and months , then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show .
President Gul ’ s visit does mark a watershed – either as a failure to make history , or as the beginning of a new era .
new YORK – next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe .
liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past , the young people of Eastern Europe ’ s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured .
yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera ’ s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past .
other examples come to mind : the accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa , Romania ’ s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade ’ s fascist past , and the attacks on the alleged “ Jewish monopoly of suffering ” which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag .
Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long , you risk becoming a devil yourself .
a Bolshevik anticommunism , similar in its dogmatism to communism itself , has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe .
in country after country , that Manichean mindset , with its oversimplifications and manipulations , was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power .
Opportunism has had its share in this , of course .
in 1945 , when the Red Army occupied Romania , the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members ; in 1989 , it had almost four million .
one day after Nicolae Ceausescu ’ s execution , most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades .
residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel , both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge , as the totalitarian state did , but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society .
former generals of the secret police and members of the Communistnomenklatura , untouchable in their comfortable villas and retirements , must derive great pleasure from watching today ’ s witch hunts and manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes .
but the case of Kundera appears different – though no less disturbing .
in 1950 , Kundera , then a 20-year-old Communist , reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met – a friend of his friend ’ s girlfriend .
the man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison .
Kundera ’ s name was contained in the investigating officer ’ s report , which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive .
the reclusive Kundera , who immigrated to Paris in 1975 , has declared that “ it never happened . ”
Moreover , Czechoslovakia ’ s fearsome secret police , who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer , never used the incident to blackmail or expose him .
until more information is forthcoming , both from Kundera and from the authorities , the case will not be solved “ beyond reasonable doubt . ”
Butif it happened , the case calls for a deeper reflection .
as far as we know , Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident , and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated .
indeed , his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950 ’ s was the most brutal period of “ proletarian dictatorship ” in Eastern Europe – a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers , fierce opponents , and apathetic bystanders alike .
Moreover , Kundera ’ s case is hardly unique .
in 2006 , the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass ’ s disclosed that , 60 years earlier , he was , as a teenager , a member of the Waffen-SS .
similarly , a few years ago , the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had , in his youth , collaborated with the fascist police .
daily life under totalitarianism , be it communist or fascist , was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding .
I don ’ t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer .
why not ?
we should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes , but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody , demagogical , and tyrannical Utopia – and of human weakness and vulnerability . we may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist ’ s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work .
but can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work ’ s merit , yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses ?
an egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists , while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police .
shouldn ’ t that cleaner ’ s drudgery to support her family , children , and her own survival be taken equally into account ?
life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special , nuanced rules toall the captives of that ordeal .
in order to understand that epoch , we have to know and carefully judge often ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances , never simplifying a multilayered daily reality for the sake of current political goals .
if nothing else , in order to forgive , we have to know what we are forgiving .
in Eastern Europe today , old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson .
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years , until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality .
London – Senator John McCain , the Republican presidential candidate , has been calling for the creation of a “ League of Democracies . ”
this new international group would possess a formidable military capacity , based partly on NATO and partly on a “ new quadrilateral security partnership ” in the Pacific between Australia , India , Japan , and the US .
neither Russia nor China , of course , would be invited to join : indeed , McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8 .
the League is necessary , argues McCain , because in matters vital to the US , such as fighting Islamic terrorism , humanitarian intervention , and spreading liberty , democracy , and free markets , the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations ( i.e. , from Russia and China ) .
in other words , the League ’ s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs .
the most damning criticism of McCain ’ s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies .
this is not only dangerous , but incoherent .
Russia and China do not “ threaten ” the “ free world ” with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces , as they did during the Cold War .
Moreover , the world ’ s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur : it was France , after all , which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq .
Moreover , on issues like terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and climate change , the US needs Russian and Chinese help .
stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board .
( China must learn to behave “ responsibly , ” McCain declares with breath-taking condescension . ) In fact , Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the “ war against terrorism . ”
finally , the idea is impracticable .
one cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination .
so we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain ’ s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible .
yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition , to which Britain ’ s former prime minister , Tony Blair , often gave eloquent expression : democracies don ’ t fight each other , so if the whole world were democratic , wars would stop .
presumably , McCain ’ s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant ’ s dream of perpetual peace closer to realization by putting pressure on non-democracies to change their ways , by force if necessary .
leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan .
is it true that democracies never fight each other ?
the affirmative answer seems to depend on two separate claims .
the first is that democracies have , as a matter of historical record , never fought each other .
this is true of a rather small group of rich countries ( India is a partial exception ) , mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots , since World War II .
Moroever , they are “ our kind ” of democracy – constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems , not “ Islamic democracies ” like Iran .
a reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that “ prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other . ”
the second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies .
but is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity , or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy ?
is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945 , or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm ?
the world already has a peace-maintaining institution .
the UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together .
members accept the obligation not to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council .
the US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN .
but the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior , including by the US .
by implicitly bypassing the UN , and dividing the world into two armed camps , the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war .
the world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism .
it is called trade .
in 1994 , the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules .
it is full of faults , which need to be corrected .
but we don ’ t need a League of Democracies to do this .
by subjecting trade relations to embargoes , sanctions , and tests of democracy , environmental standards , and human rights , the League is likely to retard the growth of trade , and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up .
the only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies – in order to spread democracy !
this is the thrust of McCain ’ s message .
as he put it , the US was built for a purpose – to serve “ eternal and universal principles . ”
its God-given task is to build an “ enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom , security , prosperity , and hope . ”
noble rhetoric !
but if that is the League ’ s purpose – and I see no other – then it is a danger to peace .
this is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-existence with non-democracies is possible .
this is crazy and unhistorical .
it is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe , which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience , to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image .
I am all for spreading Western-style democracy , but not at the cost of making the world more warlike .
peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective , and one to which all the world ’ s major powers can sign up .
Reykjavik – If African countries were to adopt only one policy to boost economic growth and improve macroeconomic stability , they should reduce the number of currencies in circulation across the continent as quickly as possible .
doing so would most likely encourage trade , as happened in Europe with the arrival of the euro , and could help contain inflation – which is always good for growth – by imposing international discipline on monetary policy .
the African Union is now aiming at pooling all the continent ’ s currencies into a single currency by 2028 .
in the meantime , several regional monetary unions are on the drawing board , in addition to the two monetary unions that already exist , onede jure and the otherde facto .
the premier and oldest of these unions is composed of the fourteen countries that belong to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and the West African Economic and Monetary Union , which both use the CFA franc .
the second of these unions is composed of Lesotho , Namibia , Swaziland , and now Zimbabwe , all of which use the South African rand .
Disregarding Zimbabwe , a recent and incomplete convert , the 18 countries of the two existing monetary unions have , as intended , benefited from lower inflation than much of the rest of Africa .
to see why , consider Nigeria .
before independence , Nigeria ’ s legal tender was the British pound .
with the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959 , the Nigerian pound was introduced .
back then , one Nigerian pound was equivalent to one British pound .
this arrangement remained intact until 1973 , when Nigeria adopted a new currency , the naira .
the exchange rate remained unchanged : one naira was equivalent to one British pound .
the naira was intended to bolster the country ‘ s independence by making it possible for the central bank to pursue its own monetary policy .
it was also a matter of national pride .
the thinking behind the new arrangement was that an independent and flexible monetary policy would serve the nation ‘ s interest better than a fixed exchange rate that tied the naira to the pound .
but the naira ’ s introduction quickly put an end to parity with the British pound .
government expenditure exceeded federal revenue , despite rapidly rising foreign-exchange earnings from oil exports after 1970 .
the federal government ’ s budget deficits were financed through foreign and domestic borrowing , and by printing money , which led to inflation and depreciation of the new currency .
today , it costs 220 naira to buy one British pound , which implies 15 % annual average depreciation since 1973 .
this depreciation would perhaps be justifiable had Nigeria managed to use easy money to narrow the gap between ordinary Nigerians ’ standard of living and that of people living in Britain .
but that did not happen .
the purchasing power of national income per person in Nigeria is now 50 % lower relative to Britain than in 1980 .
in view of this experience , Nigeria now plans to abolish the naira in favor of joining a monetary union with four or five other West African countries ( The Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Sierra Leone , and perhaps Liberia ) .
but that planned monetary union , until recently envisaged to be launched in 2009 , has now been put on ice .
why ?
the smallest countries show no signs of fear of being swamped by Nigeria , by far the most populous country in the group ( accounting for 155 million of the six countries ’ 200 million people ) , especially as the new West African Central Bank is to be located in Accra , the capital of Ghana ( 24 million ) .
others , though , may fear the dilution of their sovereignty when the new Central Bank of theWest African Monetary Zonetakes over some of the policymaking responsibilities of national central banks .
but that , of course , is the chief purpose of a monetary union .
when the West African Monetary zone finally is established , the number of currencies in Africa will equal about half the number of countries .
and when the East African Community with its five members ( Burundi , Kenya , Rwanda , Tanzania , and Uganda ) re-emerges as scheduled , the number of currencies will be reduced by another four .
the belief that sovereign national currencies , by enabling independent and flexible monetary policies , are the best way to foster economic and social development – the vision of Nigeria ’ s post-colonial leaders – is gradually falling by the wayside .
efficiency dictates the use of fewer and larger currencies ( and foreign investors , understandably wary of weak and volatile currencies , demand it ) .
indeed , the success of the European Union and of the euro since its launch in 1999 has made a strong impression in Africa.Currencies , to paraphrase Winston Churchill , are like democracies : the best way to preserve their integrity is to share them .
new YORK – The countries known collectively as the PIIGS – Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain – are burdened with increasingly unsustainable levels of public and private debt . several of the worst-hit – Portugal , Ireland , and Greece – have seen their borrowing costs soar to record highs in recent weeks , even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund .
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising .
Greece is clearly insolvent .
even with a draconian austerity package , totaling 10 % of GDP , its public debt would rise to 160 % of GDP .
Portugal – where growth has been stagnant for a decade – is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to public-sector insolvency .
in Ireland and Spain , transferring the banking system ’ s huge losses to the government ’ s balance sheet – on top of already-escalating public debt – will eventually lead to sovereign insolvency .
the official approach , Plan A , has been to pretend that these economies suffer a liquidity crunch , not a solvency problem , and that the provision of bailout loans – together with fiscal austerity and structural reforms – can restore debt sustainability and market access .
this “ extend and pretend ” or “ lend and pray ” approach is bound to fail , because , unfortunately , most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to extricate themselves from excessive debt are not feasible .
for example , the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt via inflation is unavailable to the PIIGS , because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket .
the only institution that can crank up the printing press – the European Central Bank – will never resort to monetization of fiscal deficits .
nor can we expect rapid GDP growth to save these countries .
the PIIGS ’ debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is next to impossible .
Moreover , whatever economic growth some of these countries might eventually register is contingent on enacting politically unpopular reforms that will work only in the long run – and at the cost of even more short-term pain .
to restore growth , these countries must also regain competitiveness by achieving a real depreciation of their currency , thus turning trade deficits into surpluses .
but a rising euro – pushed higher by excessively early monetary tightening by the ECB – implies more real appreciation , further undermining competitiveness .
the German solution to this conundrum – keeping wage growth below that of productivity , thereby reducing unit labor costs – took more than a decade to yield results .
if the PIIGS started that process today , the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth .
the last option – deflation of wages and prices – to reduce costs , achieve a real depreciation , and restore competitiveness is associated with ever-deepening recession .
the real depreciation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher , making them even more unsustainable .
lowering private and public consumption in order to boost private savings , and implementing fiscal austerity to reduce private and public debts , aren ’ t options , either .
the private sector can spend less and save more , but this would entail an immediate cost known as Keynes ’ paradox of thrift : declining economic output and rising debt as a share of GDP .
recent studies by the IMF and others suggest that raising taxes , cutting subsidies , and reducing government spending – even inefficient spending – would stifle growth in the short term , exacerbating the underlying debt problem .
if the PIIGS can ’ t inflate , grow , devalue , or save their way out of their problems , Plan A is either failing or is bound to fail .
the only alternative is to shift quickly to Plan B – an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries ’ governments , households , and banks .
this can happen in a number of ways .
one can carry out an orderly rescheduling of the PIIGS ’ public debts without actually reducing the principal amount owed .
this means extending the maturity dates of debts and reducing the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently unsustainable market rates .
this solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of debt principal were reduced .
policymakers should also consider innovations used to help debt-burdened developing countries in the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s .
for example , bondholders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds , which offer payouts pegged to future economic growth .
in effect , these instruments turn creditors into shareholders in a country ’ s economy , entitling them to a portion of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden .
reducing the face value of mortgages and providing the upside – in case home prices were to rise in the long run – to the creditor banks is another way to convert mortgage debt partly into shareholder equity .
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity , which would both avert a government takeover of banks and prevent socialization of bank losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis .
Europe cannot afford to continue throwing money at the problem and praying that growth and time will bring Salvation .
no one will descend from the heavens , deus ex machina , to bail out the IMF or the EU .
the creditors and bondholders who lent the money in the first place must carry their share of the burden , for the sake of the PIIGS , the EU , and their own bottom lines .
the widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly , right back to the days of opiates and cocaine , up through bromides , barbiturates , and tranquilizers : all proved to be highly addictive drugs , but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so .
now anti-depressants--global brands with household names--are the problem .
the past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions .
in England , prescriptions of anti-depressants now match Valium at its peak in 1979 .
it is now clear that today &apos;s anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being .
the sometimes intolerable withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-depressants also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects : substantial weight gain , loss of libido , and mood changes , to name just the most common complaints .
suspicions about such problems--especially about drug-induced suicidal behavior and sensitization to depression--have been rumbling for years , but searching scientific investigations have only just begun .
an important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom &apos;s drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings .
they will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug &apos;s use .
this may help , it but won &apos;t address the real issue : how could regulators have allowed this problem to recur after so much bitter experience , and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves ?
on the Richter scale of drug disasters , the looming anti-depressant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11 , where thalidomide rates a 10 .
time will tell , but the key point is this : the thalidomide disaster of the 1950 &apos;s and 1960 &apos;s happened because there was no independent control of drug safety , whereas the anti-depressant crisis has grown under theaegisof an elaborate , expensive , and global regulatory system .
the nub of the anti-depressant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm , but that they were allowed to do so when the precedents were so plain .
if and when this crisis is ever properly investigated , it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms , as expose questions about what medicine is and should be .
these underlying issues seem all the more important because the Internet has for several years been groaning with evidence of the crisis to come .
the explosive growth of the Internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering , presenting , and communicating evidence .
it broadened and deepened understanding of the problems associated with anti-depressants , giving patients a collective voice , as never before .
previously , drug safety monitoring relied on occasional adverse reports from health professionals about patients &apos; reaction to medicines .
but this crisis revealed these reports &apos; fundamental inadequacies , such that users &apos; experiences with drugs can never credibly be ignored again .
United by the Internet , many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-depressant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that bore little resemblance to the labels &apos; warnings .
the impact of this user intelligence has been profound : in 2003 , one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the incidence of withdrawal reactions from 0.2 % to 25 % ( even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is &quot; not habit forming &quot; at all ) .
the anti-depressant crisis provides , for the first time , dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk .
to be sure , user reports are not &quot; scientific &quot; and most , individually , might seem naïve , confused , exaggerated , mistaken , and / or just plain self-absorbed .
yet in this case they provided , collectively , more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials .
so , now the question is not so much the value of patients &apos; reports , but the integrity of medical research and the state of science . &quot; just how tainted has clinical medicine become , &quot; asked an editorial in the British medical journalThe Lancet in 2002 ; the answer was &quot; heavily and damagingly so . &quot;
the duplicity surrounding the marketing of anti-depressant drugs underscores just how corrupt the profession has become .
the crisis now unfolding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science , the relationship between risk and benefit , and the conflict between imperatives of trade and health .
but one feature above all others captures the underlying problem : the yawning gap between the words of patients who speak their minds and the terminology of producers , experts , and authorities who mince words .
the 1990 &apos;s saw &quot; depression &quot; formally redefined as a serotonin-deficiency disease and the scourge of millions--a convenient and seductive view , but deeply simplistic .
the term &quot; drug dependence &quot; was also redefined , to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting .
the ubiquitous term &quot; discontinuation symptoms &quot; --Orwelliannewspeak for withdrawal--implied that anti-depressants carried no risk of dependence .
on the contrary , wishful thinking led experts to adduce &quot; discontinuation symptoms &quot; as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies .
later , suicides became routinely described as &quot; non-accidental overdoses , &quot; and the broad-spectrum term &quot; emotional lability &quot; came into vogue , despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and an outburst of tears .
by contrast , user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality , rather than promote images that suit the vested interests involved .
in the long run , the anti-depressant crisis thus may prove to be a blessing in disguise , but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve .
Washington , DC ­ – America ’ s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months – political strength , that is – by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table .
if we are still making any progress at all , it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators .
most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman , a Democrat from Delaware ( yes , a pro-business state ) , who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector .
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients : arguments that persuade , the ability to bring colleagues along , and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time .
on two fronts , Kaufman has – against long odds – actually managed to make substantial steps .
long before it became fashionable , Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex , effectively at the heart of Wall Street .
this thesis is now gaining much broader traction – major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government – and by New York ’ s state attorney general – into the US financial sector ’ s residential lending and related securities practices .
with Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley , Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud .
more recently , Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives .
Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony , evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman , was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington mutual , Goldman , and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies .
Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading , which is little understood by America ’ s main financial watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , and poses systemic market risk .
his concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6 , when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function : price discovery between buyers and sellers .
we do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms , interacting across more than 50 market centers , caused this catastrophe .
but our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind “ financial innovation . ”
Kaufman ’ s approach – with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature – seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago .
no significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns – preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology .
now people get it .
as Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged , “ The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all ... I ’ ve been proud to follow his lead . ”
the SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency .
it fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership .
yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs – trades by time and customer – to understand the actions and impact of large traders .
Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more – and do it much faster ; to be sure , they and many others are now listening .
on a third issue , the results so far are mixed .
Kaufman championed the case for making America ’ s biggest banks smaller , as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts .
his advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an Amendment , co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown , that would have imposed a hard cap on banks ’ size and leverage ( debt relative to assets ) .
the Amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable , yet it went down to defeat , 33-61 , also on May 6 .
it might have gained more support just a few days later – after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks .
still , it has strengthened backing for another Amendment , sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin , which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account – coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and “ dark ” part of high-speed trading .
the deeper and overriding point of Kaufman ’ s critique of our system is the need for tough laws .
we cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing .
in particular , regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque , and when powerful Wall Street interests ( and their Capitol Hill allies ) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem .
unfortunately , despite his newfound prominence on the national stage , Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year – he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden ’ s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election .
when he goes , dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief .
let ’ s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues – preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector .
Kaufman ’ s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident : relying on deregulation and self-interest in today ’ s complex , opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth .
we must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets .
Rome – US President Barack Obama ’ s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe .
only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective , as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe ’ s division , can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings .
the crisis in Europe ’ s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences – for the region , for Europe , and for the world .
the Mediterranean region is vital to Europe ’ s peace , stability , and economic growth .
the continent ’ s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner .
and events there , including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners – first and foremost the United States .
current events , not just in Libya , but also in Tunisia , Egypt , Syria , Yemen , and Bahrain , mirror the political complexity of these countries .
they also spring from different factors , such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption , coupled with demands for greater democratization , reduction of economic and social inequalities , and job creation .
Europe ’ s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition .
proposals for some sort of “ partnership for transformation , ” based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , should bear in mind that the region ’ s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months .
no surprise , then , that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans .
chaos , a resurgence of terrorism , the rise of radical Islamism , and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated .
given this , the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region ’ s security .
just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe ’ s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability , the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs .
we need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia – and possibly a peaceful Libya – to strengthen their political stability through democratization .
the Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing .
the aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace .
the situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage .
the broad planks of a partnership are already there , so what is now needed is to enhance Europe ’ s integration with its southern neighbors .
this is why Italy has proposed a new EU “ Plan for the Mediterranean ” aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources .
the Union for the Mediterranean , launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008 , must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) .
but a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services .
let us , together with the US , tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies .
let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU ’ s internal market and participate in EU programs .
to achieve all of this , a clear set of principles is required .
we Europeans must favor stability , create a real spirit of co-ownership , and promote political responsibility.In this new framework , the EU should avoid excessive conditionality , especially during the transition period .
Europe ’ s strong support for the region ’ s economic development must remain the top priority , as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms .
Moreover , a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task .
one proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank ’ s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) , which would become an autonomous institution , perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa , with shares held by the region ’ s governments ( or other institutions ) and other willing parties .
the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region , which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises .
the EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe ; there ’ s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean .
at the same time , the EU must launch a “ dialogue among equals ” on political and security matters , aimed at confidence-building across the region .
a Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East ( CSCM ) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development .
in short , we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability .
we Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of “ mare nostrum.e ”
they are part of our collective history , and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build .
TOLEDO , Spain – This autumn , the Toledo International Centre for Peace convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East .
one conclusion that emerged was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional .
with this idea in mind , Munther Haddadin , a former Jordanian minister of water resources , proposed for the Middle East a “ Water and Energy Union , ” a long-term mechanism to integrate a fragmented region .
the idea is compelling .
Attending to such basic needs in a way that manages scarcities and surpluses regionally has a powerful logic .
indeed , the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are clear enough that , over the past month , Joschka Fischer , Germany ’ s former foreign minister , has called for such a union .
so , too , have former Czech president Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water .
having convened the meeting in Spain , we are very much in favor of the pursuit of such a worthy goal .
but the European “ coal and steel union ” became possible only after Europe ’ s major political conflicts were resolved .
a successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work .
all sides need to know where their borders begin and end .
and past injustices will need to be put aside , so that the cycle of revenge and the automatic reflex in favor of immediate gain do not scuttle regional solutions to problems .
here , the experience of a previous regional exercise is worth acknowledging .
during the 1990 ’ s , the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination concerning economic development , the environment , refugees , arms control , and water .
it failed , because when the bilateral talks collapsed , readiness to engage in regional cooperation withered under the despair of failed politics and the bloody reality of the Second intifada .
the necessary political framework also needs to be regional and , fortunately , it exists .
the Arab Peace Initiative , first tabled at an Arab League Summit in Beirut in 2002 and reconfirmed in Riyadh in 2007 , provides all the parties with a framework to resolve their differences , as well as a political basis for moving forward .
adopting it is essential to moving forward , especially if additional chapters addressing regional security and economic relations are included .
despite today ’ s chronic pessimism , the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union , coupled with adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative , would change mindsets .
together , they would form a mutually reinforcing process : a political agreement would provide the framework in which the region ’ s water and energy needs can be met ; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal .
Moreover , the arid triangle formed by Israel , Palestine , and Jordan cannot meet its water needs unless yet another dimension is incorporated into the solution .
a World Bank report has already stated that , with 19 million people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean by 2020 , water needs would not be met without making existing technologies of desalinization more economically viable .
coincidentally , over the past month , there have been early signals of greater interest in a regional political approach .
the Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that includes Israel to resolve the problems ahead ; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the United Kingdom to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace agreement ; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has said that it may be time to pursue an overall peace deal for the region , accompanied by an economic package , since separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless .
despite decades of effort , the process of trial and error through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration .
whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the persistence of the occupation .
the problems are too complex , and the dangers of radicalism too advanced , to permit success through haphazard means .
the Middle East can end its state of permanent crisis only if it builds a comprehensive foundation for peace .
the Arab Peace Initiative , combined with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union , offers the necessary basis to meet the needs of the region ’ s peoples and mitigate future conflict .
the Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence .
it can be a herald of innovation on issues of common human concern – water , energy , and politics .
WARSAW – The eurozone is often considered an experiment – a monetary union without political unification .
those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state , which possesses two relevant features : limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments and a substantial common budget from which regions hit by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers .
those who claim that “ political union ” is necessary for the eurozone appear to focus on the second feature , despite the fact that fiscal constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important component of single states .
in this sense , they ignore the fact that the European Union ’ s Stability and Growth Pact has been in principle an important component of political union , not its substitute .
indeed , the eurozone ’ s current fiscal problems do not result from the lack of a large common budget , but from weak enforcement of the Pact .
more fundamentally , monetary unions – in a broader sense – have existed not only within single states , but also in groups of sovereign states , the gold standard being the most notable example in history .
the experience of such monetary unions offers two lessons .
first , they required fiscal discipline in the member states , which was true under the gold standard , with its informal norm of balanced budgets .
second , they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center , because such a center did not exist .
instead , a great deal of flexibility , including within their labor markets , facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks .
it is clear that there is no scope in the foreseeable future to extend the EU budget in order to increase fiscal transfers to eurozone members affected by sharp declines in consumption .
this would require an enhanced level of European identity , something which the Union ’ s political elites cannot generate artificially . &amp; # 160 ; But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve , but rather that it would not address the main problem : the weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states .
instead of looking at the wrong model – that of a single state – the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions required for the proper functioning of a currency union that has no common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks .
first , utmost priority should be given to strengthening the mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks .
this requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of the accounting rules that define budget deficits and public debt , with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles , which cause deep recessions – and thus sharp increases in budget deficits – when they burst .
likewise , the European Central Bank ’ s monetary policy should “ lean against the wind ” by paying more attention to the development of asset bubbles .
as the ECB ’ s common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all the member countries , the eurozone countries need macro-prudential regulations that aim at reducing excessive credit growth .
meanwhile , the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced , which implies using and strengthening the available sanctions .
to be sure , initiatives at the EU and / or eurozone level cannot substitute for stronger mechanisms of discipline in the member states , which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and publics .
but EU-wide measures aimed at ensuring discipline are necessary to spur the growth of preventive mechanisms in the member states , and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries , which thus bear a special responsibility for the developments within the eurozone – and within the EU .
second , beyond strengthening economic institutions , EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to boost their long-run growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks .
the former are necessary to help Union members grow out of their increased public debt , while the latter would help them to address unemployment .
of the many necessary measures in this area , the most important include a vigorous effort to complete the Single Market , coupled with avoidance of economic nationalism at all costs .
Moreover , the Lisbon agenda should be reinvigorated , with a focus on market reforms , and the EU should urgently reconsider measures – particularly regarding climate policy and the drift toward an EU-wide social policy – that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and / or hamper the flexibility of markets .
in this respect , the mode of fiscal reforms is fundamentally important .
as EU members already have large tax burdens , further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth .
thus , fiscal reform should focus on reducing the growth of spending commitments , which – given the aging of EU societies – must include raising the retirement age .
finally , rigid labor markets and , more generally , regulatory constraints on prices and on the supply response of the economy , deepen recessionary reactions to various shocks , and contribute to the growth of unemployment .
therefore , labor-market liberalization should be a high priority and another area of focus for the reinvigorated Lisbon agenda .
European elites are fond of exclamations about “ European solidarity , ” “ social cohesion , ” and the “ European social model . ”
but no amount of lofty rhetoric can substitute for the reforms outlined here – or obviate the need for them .
London – There was a time when league tables were to be found only on the sports pages of newspapers .
now they are a global obsession .
there are school and university league tables , rankings of companies on profitability or corporate social responsibility , tables of happiness indicators by country , and tables that attempt to rank consumer brands by value .
there is even a league table of the world ’ s funniest jokes ( I did not laugh much ) .
the financial world is also full of such rankings .
investment bankers wait with bated breath for the merger and acquisition league tables , even though the link between a high ranking and profitability is somewhere between loose and non-existent .
Bank league tables have been with us for a while , and now tend to be based on capital strength , rather than asset volume , which is an improvement of sorts , but still not very meaningful .
there are also now several different league tables – which are generating considerable angst – that rank financial centers based largely on surveys of firms .
how badly the financial crisis damaged the reputation and performance of the major Western centers is a question increasingly asked in London , and to a lesser extent in New York .
( some Americans tend to think that the world will beat a path to their door , no matter how badly they are received when they arrive ! )
so far , the message from the most recent tables is not too alarming for the incumbents .
a ranking prepared for the City corporation in London shows New York and London still neck and neck at the top of the league .
the banker magazine produces another , with New York on top and London a close second – though the distance between them and their pursuers is narrowing .
the scores in both London and New York for the quality and intensity of regulation , and the tax burden , have dropped .
firms seem nervous about the future in both areas .
the most striking change in the rankings is the rise of major Asian financial centers – and not just Hong Kong and Singapore , but also Shanghai , Beijing , and Shenzhen .
the Chinese have been explicitly promoting their financial centers , and the impact is beginning to be seen .
the World Economic Forum ’ s Financial Development index – yet another league table to consider – shows Hong Kong and Singapore very close indeed to London , with China now ahead of Italy on the overall measure of financial sophistication .
Noodles are beating spaghetti .
some of this is unsurprising .
as the world ’ s center of economic gravity shifts east , the balance of financial activity is bound to move with it .
on the principle that if something is inevitable , it is wise to welcome it , the appropriate response in London and New York is to find ways of collaborating with these new centers .
but the more important question for the traditional financial centers is whether international activity that can move really is moving .
that is far harder to judge .
there are anecdotes about individual hedge-fund managers moving to Geneva .
every time a government , or a regulator , announces some new control , or a tightening of existing controls , there are threats from bankers that they will pack up and leave town , taking their Porsches and mistresses with them .
these threats , which used to have a lot of political impact , are now much less effective .
some politicians and commentators quickly say , “ Good riddance . ” Even the Bank of England has asked whether , given the cost of mopping up the mess caused by the latest crisis , it is worth playing host to a global financial market .
this is risky speculation .
however badly bankers have behaved – and some clearly deserve a decade or more in the sin bin – financial services are a crucial element of London ’ s economy .
if the financial sector declines , what will replace it in employment terms ?
Airy talk about science and manufacturing as ladders out of recession ( a favorite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown ) is just that – empty words .
there are few , if any , examples of high-cost post-industrial societies reviving their manufacturing sector on a large scale once it has declined .
London , in particular , has no inalienable right to be a global financial center .
the United Kingdom ’ s domestic market is , after all , much smaller than that of the United States .
indeed , the location of financial activity has changed through the centuries .
if incumbency were a permanent advantage , Goldman Sachs ’ global headquarters would be in Babylon .
there must be a tipping point at which some combination of higher taxation , more burdensome regulation , and a hostile political climate causes financial firms to relocate .
there is a risk that Britain may now be approaching that point .
that is why the UK ’ s Financial services Authority , and even the confederation of British industry , which speaks largely for non-financial firms concerned about access to credit , has begun to call for a truce between the authorities and financial markets .
the next two or three months will determine whether peace breaks out , and , if it does , whether it will endure .
as is always the case in peace negotiations , both sides must be willing to compromise .
firms will need to show visible restraint when it comes to this year ’ s bonus round .
the British government will not tolerate another jamboree .
and governments on both sides of the Atlantic will need to decide just how far they want to go in punishing banks .
continued threats of ever-higher tax burdens could prove dangerously counterproductive .
if we fail to settle on a new social contract between the state and the markets soon , those markets may indeed move elsewhere .
it is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin ’ s “ dictatorship of law ” has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless .
the murder of Anna Politkovskaya , one of Russia ’ s bravest and best journalists , a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya , is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the Mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law .
this recognition is a timely one for the world to make , particularly Europe . Germany ’ s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian / German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin ’ s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union .
but indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena , as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia ’ s economy .
the killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense ofdéjà vu : just as in the KGB ’ s heyday , people simply disappear in Putin ’ s Russia .
Politkovskaya ’ s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks .
Enver Ziganshin , the chief engineer of BP Russia , was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30 .
Andrei Kozlov , the deputy Governor of Russia ’ s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud , was assassinated on September 14 .
the fact that Russia ’ s prosecutor General Yuri Chaika , took over the investigation into Politkovskaya ’ s killing , as he did with the murder of Kozlov , doesn ’ t inspire hope , as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy .
in fact , the involvement of the highest level of Russia ’ s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found .
Politkovskaya ’ s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia ’ s President .
in her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow , Novaya Gazeta , and in her books “ Putin &apos;s Russia : life in a failing Democracy ” and “ A Dirty War : a Russian Reporter in Chechnya , ” Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin ’ s presidency .
as shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky , and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky , three fates await Putin ’ s enemies : exile , imprisonment , or the grave .
I am not accusing Putin ’ s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya .
after all , as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin , not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister , Ramzan Kadyrov , whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom .
but even if Vladimir Putin ’ s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow , his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out .
like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago , the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king .
given what Politkovskaya represented — the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies — the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her .
Putin ’ s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years .
none of those crimes has been solved , which would not be the case if Putin ’ s “ dictatorship of law ” was anything more than a PR strategy .
the six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals .
on one hand , the world sees a young , educated leader pledging to modernize Russia , particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms .
on the other , the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia &apos;s FSB security service ( the former KGB ) provide no security to those murdered , and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists , scientists , and environmental activists .
these “ neo-spies ” include journalist Gregory Pasko , arms control expert Igor Sutyagin , diplomat Valentin Moiseyev , physicist Valentin Danilov , and others .
the supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin ’ s Kremlin cabal .
once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin village ; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions , but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule .
the danger for the world is that Putin ’ s lawlessness is being exported .
across Russia ’ s near abroad , a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root .
look at Putin ’ s attempt to rig Ukraine ’ s previous presidential election , and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko .
look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin ’ s backing .
look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies .
every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior , criminals grow bolder .
it is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is : a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows .
so the world must now ponder that old Latin maximqui tacet consenterevidetur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin ’ s construction of a lawless energy superpower .
new YORK – The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media .
television has reshaped society in every corner of the world .
now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set : DVDs , computers , game boxes , smart phones , and more .
a growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects .
the United States led the world into the television age , and the implications can be seen most directly in America ’ s long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called “ the glass teat . ”
in 1950 , fewer than 8 % of American households owned a TV ; by 1960 , 90 % had one .
that level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere , and the poorest countries are still not there .
true to form , Americans became the greatest TV watchers , which is probably still true today , even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete .
the best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount , given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices .
other countries log far fewer viewing hours .
in Scandinavia , for example , time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average .
the consequences for American society are profound , troubling , and a warning to the world – though it probably comes far too late to be heeded .
first , heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure .
many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction , with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse .
such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do .
Moreover , heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation .
time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen .
Robert Putnam , the leading scholar of America ’ s declining sense of community , has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “ social capital , ” the trust that binds communities together .
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago .
of course , many other factors are at work , but television-driven social atomization should not be understated .
certainly , heavy TV viewing is bad for one ’ s physical and mental health .
Americans lead the world in obesity , with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight .
again , many factors underlie this , including a diet of cheap , unhealthy fried foods , but the sedentary time spent in front of the TV is an important influence as well .
at the same time , what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically .
television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society .
America ’ s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands , and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising .
effective advertising campaigns , appealing to unconscious urges – typically related to food , sex , and status – create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society .
the same , of course , has happened to politics .
American politicians are now brand names , packaged like breakfast cereal .
anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle .
all roads to power in America lead through TV , and all access to TV depends on big money .
this simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before .
even war can be rolled out as a new product .
the Bush administration promoted the premises of the Iraq war – Saddam Hussein ’ s non-existent weapons of mass destruction – in the familiar colorful , fast-paced , and graphics-heavy style of television advertising .
then the war itself began with the so-called “ shock and awe ” bombing of Baghdad – a made-for-TV live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the US-led invasion .
many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction , consumerism , loss of social trust , and political propaganda .
perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers ’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities .
the American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that TV viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development , and called on parents to keep children under two away from the TV and similar media .
a recent survey in the US by the organization Common sense media reveals a paradox , but one that is perfectly understandable .
children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households , but are also more likely to have a television in their room .
when a commodity ’ s consumption falls as income rises , economists call it an “ inferior ” good .
to be sure , the mass media can be useful as a provider of information , education , entertainment , and even political awareness .
but too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid .
at the very least , we can minimize those dangers .
successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising , especially to young children ; non-commercial , publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC ; and free ( but limited ) TV time for political campaigns .
of course , the best defense is our own self-control .
we can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading , talking with each other , and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust .
these are violent times .
some believe that we are experiencing a new kind of conflict : “ culture wars , ” such as those between Sunni and Shiite Muslims or tribal groups in Africa and Asia , or indeed Islamists and Westerners .
however , the deeper reasons for some of these conflicts may well be more traditional .
belonging to a particular cultural group is merely a pretext for battles between the winners and losers of globalization .
ruthless leaders mobilize disoriented followers .
particularly the losers , often represented by young men with no future to look forward to , can be induced to take even suicidal action against the alleged enemy .
perhaps one should not be surprised that at such a time , the oldest of our ugly ­ – indeed , deadly – resentments , anti-Semitism , is re-emerging from the shadows .
its comeback takes the classical form of attacks on individuals , like the recent killing of a young Jew in France , or of disfiguring symbolic places , like cemeteries and synagogues .
but there is also a more general sense of hostility to all things Jewish .
one would have thought that anti-Semitism died forever with the Holocaust ; but it did not .
there are those who deny that the Holocaust ever took place , or that it did in its all-too-well-documented manner .
the deniers range from second-rate historians like David Irving to apparently popular politicians like Iran ’ s recently elected president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
the evidence of what Nazi Germany did is so powerful that those who deny it can probably be dealt with even without putting them in prison and thereby drawing more attention to them than they deserve .
the more worrisome source of anti-Semitism is different and justifies speaking of a new anti-Semitism .
it has to do with Israel .
to be sure , America is the first name in anti-Western resentment .
but its second name is Israel , the only successful modern country in the Middle East , which is also highly militarized , an occupying power , and ruthless in defense of its interests .
it is difficult to exaggerate the strange sentiment in the West which one might call Palestine romanticism .
intellectuals like the late Edward said gave voice to it , but it has many followers in the United States and Europe .
Palestine romanticism glorifies the Palestinians as the victims of Israel ’ s rule , points to the treatment of Israeli Palestinians as at best second-class citizens , and cites the many incidents of oppression in the occupied territories , including the effects of Israel ’ s “ security fence . ”
implicitly or explicitly , people take the side of the victims , contribute by sending money to them , declare even suicide bombers legitimate , and move ever further away from support for and defense of Israel .
of course , it is true that in theory one can oppose Israel ’ s policies without being anti-Semitic .
after all , there are enough critics of Israel ’ s policies among Israelis .
yet the distinction has become more and more difficult to maintain .
Jews outside Israel feel that they have to defend – right or wrong – the country that , after all , is their ultimate hope of security .
this makes their friends hesitate to speak up for fear of being painted into not just an anti-Israel , but also an anti-Semitic corner .
the defensiveness of Jews and the uneasy silence of their friends mean that the stage of public debate is open for those who actually are anti-Semitic , though they confine themselves to anti-Israel language .
anti-Semitism is disgusting in whatever form it arises .
this is true also for other kinds of group hatred , but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism unique , because it is an emotion complicit in the near annihilation of an entire people .
the new anti-Semitism , however , cannot be fought successfully by education and argument in the rest of the world alone .
it is linked to Israel .
if one belongs to a generation that regarded Israel as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century , and admired the way in which the country provided a proud home for the persecuted and downtrodden , one is particularly concerned that it may now be at risk .
Seoul – The long-delayed meeting of North Korea ’ s ruling worker ’ s Party is now underway , and comes at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community .
it is widely expected that Kim Jong-il ’ s third son , Kim Jong-eun , will be appointed to a key position and be publicly announced as his father ’ s successor .
there are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place , allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base .
whatever happens , and whoever turns out to be the new leader , North Korea most likely faces an unstable future .
the cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise as the system ’ s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront stark new challenges .
Moreover , responsibility for managing that potential instability extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang .
North Korea ’ s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important political event as the worker ’ s Party conference , held for the first time in three decades , was abruptly postponed earlier in September .
one cause for the delay could be a schism within the ruling elite , a group that “ dear Leader ” Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before .
Moreover , Kim ’ s health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess , further complicating matters .
“ enough is enough , ” a mid-level North Korean government official recently uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding Kim Jong-eun ’ s likely succession .
ordinary North Koreans , too , evidently seem to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il ’ s inheritance of power from his father , Kim Il-sung .
Moreover , there is no hope that any new leader , whoever it may be , will get any breathing space to establish unquestioned control , given the economy ’ s utter state of decay , as last year ’ s failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated .
the regime is under growing pressure from those at the bottom of North Korean society , and recognizes its own inability to handle the situation .
for example , for the first time , North Korea ’ s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error – the failure of the currency redenomination .
for the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea ’ s people and its rulers seems to be changing fundamentally .
one troubling aspect of this change is that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in order to suppress popular resistance .
and , at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic isolation , North Korea ’ s leaders , their confidence boosted by their possession of nuclear weapons , might try to distract their public through audacious , and possibly destructive , acts abroad .
the attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of things to come .
indeed , the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime ’ s internal weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture – the latter being the authorities ’ fearful response to the former .
unfortunately , however , most international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease .
of course , in order to pressure North Korea ’ s government to give up its nuclear option , the current international economic sanctions , which target WMD-related products and luxury goods , probably should continue .
but , at the same time , the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform .
at a time of increased tension between North Korea , South Korea , and the United States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake .
yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed .
if , say , North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior , it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund .
Western governments also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy .
of course , any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes .
the international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing the regime ’ s will to reform .
in fact , following the recent currency fiasco , North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before .
such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy , which has been to pressure North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform .
to be sure , North Korea ’ s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement .
conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered .
but there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea ’ s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform .
we need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously .
on the contrary , it may be impossible to win North Korea ’ s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change .
the past two decades have shown that “ politically correct ” decisions do not produce the “ right ” results , even in the long run .
as North Korea grooms a new leader , the world needs to groom a new policy for North Korea .
the United Nations is torn apart by internal tensions .
no sooner was the controversy over the creation of a Human Rights Council satisfactorily resolved than a new battle has erupted .
the United States is pressing for administrative reforms and threatening to cut off funding if the reforms are not forthcoming .
the Secretary General has submitted a reasonable reform plan , but a majority of UN member states , acting together as the so-called G-77 , are balking , because they regard it as another step in reducing the authority of the General Assembly relative to the Security Council .
in particular , they object to the plan ’ s proposal to give increased powers and responsibilities to the Secretary General , whose selection is effectively in the hands of the Security Council ’ s five permanent members , which wield veto power .
many UN members , believing that power within the UN has been shifting from the General Assembly , resist giving up what they regard as its last vestige : control over the budget through the work of the Assembly ’ s fifth Committee .
in practice , the fifth Committee has exercised the kind of micro-management over personnel and expenditure that ought to be exercised by the Secretary General if the UN is to operate effectively and to have a staff which is up to the challenges facing the organization .
this is the basis of America ’ s insistence on administrative reforms .
there is an urgent need to find a way out of this impasse .
failure of the current proposal would mean an effective end to all efforts to reform the UN , with disastrous consequences for people across the world who depend on the aid provided by the UN Development Program , the security provided by the UN ’ s numerous peacekeeping operations , or the myriad other services rendered by UN agencies .
for example , failure of management reform would fuel demands by the US Congress to withhold America ’ s contributions to the UN budget – a policy that would greatly undermine America ’ s own interests , such as the planned expansion of the mission to stop genocide in Darfur .
the path to a satisfactory resolution is clear : give the General Assembly a greater role in the selection of the Secretary General so that members would be delegating powers to an authority of their own choosing .
this solution would not only permit the much-needed administrative reforms to be implemented ; it would also bring clarity and transparency to a process that is in great need of improvement .
after all , the UN Charter provides that “ the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council . ”
the original concept was that the two bodies would reach a consensus on a candidate .
in practice , however , the five permanent members now agree on a candidate , and their decision is rubber-stamped first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly .
real discussions about a new Secretary General are currently being conducted in secrecy among the permanent five , adding to the frustration of other UN members , including large powers that have been seeking without success to enlarge the Security Council .
to achieve the reforms of the budget process that it wants , the US will need to lead the way in persuading the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in the process .
this might be done in several ways .
the Security Council might agree to recommend several candidates from which the General Assembly would select one .
Alternatively , the General Assembly might propose several candidates to the Security Council , from which the Council would choose one to refer back to the Assembly for approval .
either way , the selection process would benefit from greater transparency .
for example , the General Assembly should hold public hearings in which candidates are interviewed , thereby greatly enhancing the stature of the candidate who is eventually selected .
such proposals , if accepted , would help resolve the current dispute to everyone ’ s satisfaction .
indeed , they could make the UN stronger than it has ever been .
a remarkable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists .
earlier this year , the government suspended publication of the newspaperBing Dian Weekly , provoking unprecedented open protest , which received extensive media coverage worldwide .
even more surprisingly , the government , under the pressure of public opinion , has allowedBing Dianto resume publication .
the editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief were sacked , but the open questioning of the legitimacy of the government ’ s authority to regulate journalism is bound to have a profound impact .
foreign observers are prone to associate theBing Dianincident with other recent crackdowns on China ’ s mass media , and to conclude that Chinese journalism freedom is hopeless under the present autocratic regulation .
Undeniably , there has been no significant change in the government ’ s system of journalism ’ s regulation since China adopted its “ open door ” policy almost 30 years ago .
on the contrary , it has become more rigorous and covert .
but I still have faith that subtle changes are occurring .
a prerequisite of effective control of the media is that the controlled accept the controller ’ s ideology .
after 1949 , the Communist Party cultivated a stable of “ theoretical experts ” and other ideological servants to write lengthy articles propagating “ Marxism and Mao Zedong thought . ”
but nowadays , such writers are hard to find , and their work is received by readers with mockery and sarcasm .
in fact , the Central propaganda Department ’ s ideological control can be maintained only through internal notices and telephone calls , which are widely scorned .
more importantly , even the regulators themselves have ceased to believe in obsolete and rigid doctrines .
I recently met an official working for a provincial Department of propaganda and was impressed by his bold and straightforward comments on current affairs .
in private conversation , one might even take him for a liberal – one of a new breed of young and well-educated propaganda officials with an increasingly higher threshold of political sensitivity .
for their part , producers of news have long since ceased to believe that news is propaganda .
I started my career with China Youth Dailyin 1979 and have experienced the whole process of China ’ s opening up and reformation .
our generation of Chinese journalists broke from traditional Communist ideas about journalism by the mid-1980 ’ s through extensive reading of Western journalism .
younger journalists have thus been exposed to Western journalistic ideas from the very beginning .
indeed , Western works are taught as “ models for writing ” to journalism students in China ’ s universities .
this is a crucial change , and it is the fundamental reason for an increasing number of genuine news items and commentaries in China ’ s media today .
market pressure has also been important in pushing Chinese media to embrace change .
contrary to foreign perceptions , only a handful of Chinese media – for example , People ’ s Daily , Guang Ming Daily , and theEconomic Daily – still live on government funds.China Central television relies mainly on its advertising income , with only a symbolic fraction of its massive budget covered by the government .
whether most media outlet can survive is thus solely dependent on their market success .
to be sure , political information remains rigorously controlled , which puts a premium on “ harmless ” recreational , entertainment , and sports information – the reporting of which is basically free .
this has resulted , in the short run , in an embrace of low journalistic standards .
but many metropolitan newspapers that once thrived on infotainment have seen their circulation fall in recent years .
sooner or later , readers will start to buy newspapers that can truly inform them and give voice to their opinions .
in fact , it is these tabloids , responding to market pressure , that have started to take on responsibility as public watchdogs .
on many occasions in recent years , they have been the first to break sensitive news .
as a result , mainstream media are being marginalized , and the previously marginalized media are becoming mainstream .
thus , even without any change in the current system of regulation , extensive coverage of disasters , judicial abuses , and citizens ’ pursuit of their statutory rights , along with the questioning of policies from public perspectives , is now common .
for example , reporting by theSouth Metropolitan Daily led to the abolition of an outdated housing ordinance issued by the State Council.Cai Jing magazine ’ s continuous reporting on SARS enabled the Chinese public to learn the truth about this epidemic .
TheBing DianWeekly ofChina Youth Dailypublished an article by Taiwanese writer long Yingtai on Taiwan ’ s democratic development .
such progress is slow and full of frustrations , for it reflects the incremental evolution of the system .
but it is nonetheless real progress , indicating the growing influence of the Chinese media and pointing to China ’ s becoming a country of “ free expression ” .
according to an old Chinese saying , “ a just cause enjoys abundant support , while an unjust cause finds scant support . ” A “ just cause ” resides in people ’ s hearts .
without the hearts of news producers – or , increasingly , of censors – the seemingly formidable edifice of journalistic regulation will , sooner or later , collapse like the Berlin Wall .
new YORK – many poor , food-importing countries around the world have become desperate in recent months , as global prices of rice , wheat , and maize have doubled .
hundreds of millions of poor people , who already spend a large share of their daily budget on food , are being pushed to the edge .
food riots are mounting .
but many poor countries can grow more food themselves , because their farmers are producing far below what is technologically possible .
in some cases , with appropriate government action , they could double or even triple food production in just a few years .
the idea is basic and well known .
traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields .
poor peasants use their own seeds from the preceding season , lack fertilizer , depend on rain rather than irrigation , and have little if any mechanization beyond a traditional hoe .
their farms are small , perhaps one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) or less .
under traditional agricultural conditions , the yields of grain – rice , wheat , maize , sorghum , or millet – are usually around one ton per hectare , for one planting season per year .
for a farm family of five or six living on one hectare , this means extreme poverty , and for their country , it means reliance on expensive food imports , including food aid .
the solution is to increase grain yields to at least two tons – and in some places to three or more tons – per hectare .
if water can be managed through irrigation , this could be combined with multi-cropping ( multiple harvests per year ) to produce a crop during the dry season .
higher and more frequent yields mean less poverty in farm families , and lower food prices for cities .
the key to increasing yields is to ensure that even the poorest farmers have access to improved seed varieties ( usually “ hybrid ” seeds created by scientific selection of seed varieties ) , chemical fertilizers , organic matter to replenish soil nutrients , and , where possible , small-scale irrigation methods , such as a pump to lift water from a nearby well .
there is nothing magic about this combination of high-yield seeds , fertilizer , and small-scale irrigation .
it is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960 ’ s .
the problem is that these improved inputs have bypassed the poorest farmers and the poorest countries .
when peasants lack their own saving accounts and collateral , they are unable to borrow from banks to buy seeds , fertilizer , and irrigation .
as a result , they grow food the traditional way , often earning little or nothing from their harvest , because it ’ s not even enough to keep their families alive .
history has shown that government action is required to help the poorest farmers escape the low-yield poverty trap .
if farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies , income can rise , and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral .
with a bit of temporary help , perhaps lasting around five years , farmers can build up enough wealth to obtain inputs on a market basis , either through direct purchases from savings or through bank loans .
around the world , government-run agricultural banks in poor countries once not only financed inputs , but also provided agricultural advice and spread new seed technologies .
of course , there were abuses , such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones , or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy .
and in many cases , government agricultural banks went bankrupt .
still , the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid .
during the debt crisis of the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , the International Monetary Fund and World Bank forced dozens of poor food-importing countries to dismantle these state systems .
poor farmers were told to fend for themselves , to let “ market forces ” provide for inputs .
this was a profound mistake : there were no such market forces .
poor farmers lost access to fertilizers and improved seed varieties .
they could not obtain bank financing .
to its credit , the World Bank recognized this mistake in a scathing internal evaluation of its long-standing agricultural policies last year .
the time has come to reestablish public financing systems that enable small farmers in the poorest countries , notably those farming on two hectares or less , to gain access to needed inputs of high-yield seeds , fertilizer , and small-scale irrigation .
Malawi has done this for the past three seasons , and has doubled its food production as a result .
other low-income countries should follow suit .
importantly , the World Bank , under its new president , Robert Zoellick , has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach .
if the Bank provides grants to poor countries to help small peasant farmers gain access to improved inputs , then it will be possible for those countries to increase their food production in a short period of time .
donor governments , including the oil-rich countries of the Middle East , should help finance the World Bank ’ s new efforts .
the world should set as a practical goal of doubling grain yields in low-income Africa and similar regions ( such as Haiti ) during the next five years .
that ’ s achievable if the World Bank , donor governments , and poor countries direct their attention to the urgent needs of the world ’ s poorest farmers .
whatever happened to the European Union ’ s Lisbon Strategy ?
not only is the public almost entirely ignorant of the EU ’ s policy agenda for boosting competitiveness , economic growth , and employment , but this ignorance extends to many intellectuals , academics , CEO ’ s , and even some MP ’ s .
for example , in all of the debates on the EU ’ s constitutional treaty , neither its supporters nor its opponents have so much as mentioned the Lisbon Strategy .
it is little wonder , then , that Euroskepticism – in France , the Netherlands , and elsewhere – is on the rise .
despite the success and popularity of programs like ERASMUS , citizens don ’ t perceive the EU ’ s contribution to superior education or training .
indeed , the last Eurobarometer survey on the Lisbon Strategy found that the European public sees little relation between EU policies and economic competitiveness .
of course , some laboratories receive EU grants , but without recognizing a specific European mission in research policies .
Europe is generally considered more a constraint than as a plan , more as an instrument than a vision nourished by a clear and credible idea .
the essential responsibility for this state of affairs lies with Europe ’ s ruling class and policymakers .
as a recent assessment by former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok pointed out , the EU ’ s member states generally have not made the Lisbon Strategy a high priority , and they balk at giving the EU the means to pursue more ambitious policies to offset this neglect .
it is difficult to ask citizens to be enthusiastic about aims that their leaders ignore .
at bottom , the problem is one of legitimacy .
the main targets – jobs , growth , and research – are considered legitimate from the standpoint of fairness when described in general terms .
but the concrete policies needed to realize this aim are not , since reforming the welfare state and labor markets means more competition , which scares many citizens .
legitimacy is even more problematic regarding recognition , which implies a feeling of community and attachment .
when we are faced with conflicting choices – burden-sharing through taxation , the organization of the public sector , the status of public employees , etc . – the member states are considered to be the only bodies entitled to decide .
in short , when the EU brings subsidies , it receives congratulations ; but when it pushes for unpopular reforms , it becomes the scapegoat for political , social , and economic failures .
from an economic point of view , the Lisbon Strategy ’ s aim is to transform Europe into a power able to compete on equal terms with the US today and the great Asian countries .
but this aim does not appear to be creating a European identity , as the euro has .
within many states , “ power ” isn ’ t politically correct .
above all , there is no linkage between national power and European power .
if we want Europe to be more legitimate , we must explain how to tie these two dimensions of power .
aside from ignorance of the Lisbon Strategy among the public and inaction on long-term reforms among the member states , a second problem concerns the lack of acceptance of the virtues of competition – the most effective way to ensure quality , innovation , and low prices for consumers .
competition also puts an end to rent seeking and protection of traditional corporate advantages .
of course , we must limit the scope of competition : there is no reason , for example , to extend it to taxation .
similarly , while competition will improve the quality of research and education , this does not imply reduced public funding , a lower priority for basic research , or the elimination of scholarships .
perhaps most importantly , competition is a powerful means to restore democracy and modernize political institutions by compelling policymakers to ensure transparency and accountability .
elites must give up their privileges , and regulations on corporate governance must limit collusion between managers and civil servants or politicians .
we must explain to citizens Europe ’ s contribution to public ethics , and the democratic virtues of fair competition in economic , political , and social life .
consider one of the main purposes of the Lisbon Strategy : the organization of research and higher education .
it is impossible to change radically the way scholars and research workers are appointed in most member states , and to revise completely the criteria for funding of faculties and laboratories .
but the EU can overcome national impediments by developing exemplary universities and research centers that would be properly European , serving as an incentive to quality and reform at the national level .
Emulation through excellence is the motor of competitiveness .
a good place to start is an idea supported by French Socialist leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn , who has proposed that 0.25 % of Europe ’ s GDP be dedicated to research and used to create a European Agency for Research .
Moreover , Europe must build up tools for strategic analysis , assessment , and forecasting to provoke and nourish public debate .
such think tanks at the European level must remain free and independent , but leaders must learn to pay attention to and integrate their recommendations into the policy-making process .
in many matters pertaining to the Lisbon Strategy , the EU cannot avoid member states ’ concerns .
but as the states won ’ t be able to do everything alone and won ’ t renounce maintaining political control , we must be able to link the Union ’ s policies and those of specific states .
otherwise , the Lisbon Strategy could merely empower an inefficient bureaucracy , rather than boosting the EU ’ s democratic legitimacy .
in short , the Lisbon Strategy could lead Europe to become a real power in the coming decades , or it could fuel further growth of Euroskepticism .
as former members of our countries &apos; congresses we believe that it is time to create a North American parliamentary Union ( NAPU ) to address the growing number of big issues that North America &apos;s national governments have pushed to the sidelines .
both past and present have been burdened by thead hoc nature of relations among the United States , Mexico , and Canada .
a fairer , more prosperous future for all three countries demands that we take a bold step forward .
despite US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s snide reference to ``Old Europe , &apos; &apos; North Americans can learn much from the European Union and European Parliament .
in the 1950 &apos;s , most of Europe considered the idea of a Union with a single Parliament a pipe dream .
today the EU elects its Parliament , shares a single currency , and controls a budget that emphasizes raising living standards within the less developed member countries .
within the near future , the EU is likely to be 450 million people strong .
the combined population of the US , Mexico , and Canada is about 410 million people .
yet North America has failed to match Europe in building the political structures necessary to focus the hemisphere on the problems of immigration , cross border security , labor rights , and environmental degradation ; or in facilitating a more united approach to strong economic competition from Europe and Asia .
on the contrary , in the aftermath of the Iraq War , relations between the US and its neighbors , Canada and Mexico , are at their lowest level in years .
clearly , efforts to deepen North American political and economic integration will be an uphill battle .
in the near future , the US government will be focused on homeland security , Iraq , the slumping domestic economy , and the run-up to the 2004 presidential election .
Canada &apos;s government has been more willing to approach North American issues on a bilateral basis than in a tri-national context ; furthermore , Canadians are preoccupied with the consequences and aftermath of SARS and mad cow disease , as well as anticipating a new government next year .
Mexico &apos;s President Vincente Fox will govern through 2006 .
but his vision of a North American Free Trade Association ( NAFTA ) encompassing elements of social and political fusion with his North American counterparts was sidetracked by the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and by his political rivals &apos; recent successes at the polls .
notwithstanding this , most Canadians and Mexicans believe that cooperation in North America will proceed regardless of who is in office in Ottawa , Washington , or Mexico City .
not only are Canada and Mexico the US &apos;s first and second largest trading partners , but the three countries maintain a myriad of relationships--in business , tourism , and culture--that do not pass through their embassies or governments .
good feelings abound .
US citizens register high approval ratings in Canada and Mexico : 90 % and 70 % , respectively .
in proposing the creation of NAPU , we envision a specific plan to create a larger market by fostering an alliance between the three economies .
in just a single decade , the EU managed to bring poorer , peripheral member states--Greece , Portugal , Spain , and Ireland--from 50 % to 90 % of the EU average in per capita income , creating a bigger market for companies from wealthier northern countries , and stemming migration from poorer southern economies .
the EU invested upwards of $ 35 billion a year to assure the success of their Common Market integration .
North America has largely ignored the significance of ``common , &apos; &apos; preferring to focus on ``market . &apos; &apos;
this blinded all three countries to the centrality of community .
we have failed to understand that a North American Free Trade area ( NAFTA ) that achieves its full potential cannot be accomplished on the cheap .
a regional political structure will maintain the focus on vital but difficult issues such as immigration .
NAFTA was conceived under the assumption that expanded trade would trickle down benefits to all in the three countries .
Regretfully , this corporate-driven NAFTA exacerbated the disparities and asymmetries between Mexico and its two richer northern neighbors .
Moreover , throughout NAFTA &apos;s lifetime income and wealth have been further concentrated within the elite sectors of US and Canadian society .
immigration illustrates the cost of integration without convergence .
demand for low-cost Mexican labor by US employers and the 10-1 wage gap between the two countries pushes 350,000 Mexicans to risk their lives every year for better paid jobs north of the border .
without Mexican manpower , much of the work in the US simply would not get done .
the issue must be addressed , not ignored and criminalized .
NAPU would be the ideal forum in which to address this concern .
everywhere nowadays , key decisions are made by a self-selected group of elites , often in non-transparent circumstances .
NAPU would allow for wider , more consistent participation in the consideration of issues now ignored in all three countries .
Inter-American issues can no longer be left subject to the whims and convenience of individual leaders .
the people of the US , Canada , and Mexico deserve better .
for a few hundred years , when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention , one region of the world stood out .
masters of these disciplines were revered there , medicine advanced quickly , and the average person was curious about how nature worked .
not surprisingly , this region was globally respected .
in the other half of the known planet , scientists were punished , even killed .
mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien , and was later made subservient to religion .
the standard of living was low .
the prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East , while an ignorant Europe remained poor .
both regions were religiously governed ( historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context ) , but science flourished only in one of them .
now , of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed .
since World War II , the United States has been the world ’ s undisputed leader in science .
throughout this period , the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands , attracted by superior research universities and opportunities .
until recently , more than half of all mathematics , science , and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born .
many of these talents stayed after graduation , and both industry and government took advantage of this .
meanwhile , Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed .
even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research , Arab rulers did not encourage such investment , with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have .
recently , a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology , which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions .
but while such weapons carry political weight , the science behind them is mundane and old .
more meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights , rather than the products of past discoveries .
imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research .
would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS ?
this is one unclaimed opportunity .
but another exists , and not just for Islamic societies .
the US has made profound missteps recently .
“ matters of faith ” have been substituted for science across government , from the president down .
top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief .
encouraged by a religiously influenced administration , school systems are shifting their focus from science to “ values . ”
since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 , entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain , stanching the flow of young talent into US universities .
major scientific organizations have protested , without result .
at the same time , tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term , discouraging long-term investment in research .
half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq , an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years .
even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age , it clearly risks losing its global research dominance .
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980 ’ s .
Japan ’ s chief industrialist , Akio Morita , the chairman of Sony , and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book calledTheJapan that Can say No .
they outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership .
the key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the “ food chain ” of military technologies was controlled by other nations .
the book ’ s title refers to Japan ’ s plan to “ say no ” to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies .
building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible .
for example , Texas , like most southern US states , was once economically poor and declining .
although it had oil revenue , the flow of dollars into an economy , by itself , does not boost prosperity as much as one might think .
so Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment .
today , that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities .
the effect has been staggering : Aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California , but is booming in Texas .
telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas , even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel .
although manufacturing in the US is in crisis , Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world .
there is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East .
first , however , the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage .
London &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; The recent meeting in the Vatican of the “ Custodian of The Holy places , ” King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , and Pope Benedict XVI was a seminal event , particularly as it comes at a time when radical Muslims are decrying the role of “ crusaders ” in Middle East politics .
it was also the clearest sign yet of a rising “ Holy Alliance ” among the world ’ s conservative leaders .
for the key audience for this meeting of Muslim king and Roman Catholic Pontiff was not their followers , but another conservative leader , President George W. Bush .
the first “ Holy Alliance ” was a creation of Austria ’ s Prince Metternich following the Napoleonic wars .
it was an attempt to preserve the peace ( and the security of the relatively weak Austrian Empire ) through a coalition of victors upholding shared values .
Metternich ’ s “ Holy Alliance ” was the one original political idea to emerge from Napoleon ’ s defeat .
behind its exalted name lay an innovation of great diplomatic significance : the introduction of an element of calculated moral restraint into international relations .
the vested interests that the Alliance members – Austria , Prussia , and Russia – had in the survival of their domestic institutions led each to seek to avoid conflicts that , in the past , they would have pursued as a matter of course .
Metternich ’ s system worked through much of the nineteenth century , because it protected a genuine balance of power between countries that shared common values .
but what “ common values ” do King , Pope , and American President share ?
that such a meeting took place is a sign that both Pope and King believed that there was something to achieve .
indeed , Abdullah , who believes himself to be the paramount leader of the Muslim world , is the first Saudi king to initiate a meeting with a leader of the Christian faith .
the two men met , seemingly as equals , not to express the common values of conservatism , but to confirm and promote their authority to uphold traditional values .
both agreed that reform must be slow , cautious and that it must never undermine established institutions , especially religion and the patriarchal family .
Abdullah sought the meeting because he believes that the world since 2001 has divided the fraternity of conservatives .
until then , he and Bush shared a common worldview , emphasizing the importance of religion , the traditional family ( as both countries understood it ) , social discipline , and the state ’ s role in supporting these institutions .
but Bush , following the terrorist attacks of 2001 , turned his back on conservatism . he sought to radically reinvent the Middle East , not only by overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein ’ s regime in Iraq , but also through his strident calls for democratization .
American radicalism , however , resulted in increasing tensions between religious communities in the Middle East , and the rise of radical Iran with its bid for regional hegemony .
since 2001 , Christian minorities have been targeted throughout the region , including even Lebanon ’ s Maronite Christian community .
and in Iraq , Sunni Muslims feel under siege from the country ’ s majority and now ruling Shia .
here is where the Holy Alliance concept of moral restraint comes in .
Abdullah , perhaps earlier than most others , understood that some code of restraint was needed if the entire region was not to descend into a war of all against all .
Moreover , Abdullah understands that his wobbly regime will only be able to withstand the radical gales that are now blowing if it can forge the type of stability-seeking alliance that Metternich built .
the King , like Metternich and the Austrian Kaisers , understands de Tocqueville ’ s dictum that the most dangerous moment for a regime is when it starts to reform .
having begun , ever so carefully , to politically open his country , the King knows that he needs regional peace and a lowering of Islamic holy rage .
the problem is that Abdullah cannot rely on his domestic conservative allies to give him the time that the Kingdom needs .
the Wahhabi religious establishment , the Saudi state ’ s hidden co-rulers , could very well obstruct Abdullah ’ s attempts at regional religious reconciliation .
members of the religious police remain adamant that the country ’ s Christian guests must continue to live according to strict Wahhabi rules of behavior .
while the Wahhabis could yet be bribed again with oil money , the sect ’ s power-hungry judges eagerly await the next beheading , stoning , or lashing in Riyadh ’ s public square .
thus , uniting the forces of status quo conservatism , even if some of those conservatives are Christian , is the only viable diplomatic strategy open to Saudi Arabia .
for conservative rulers usually fall when they fail to grasp their own vulnerability , especially when the revolutionary challenge is cloaked in conservative garb .
after all , few political systems can defend against those , like Saudi Arabia ’ s Islamic radicals , who claim that they can preserve the system and its religious values more effectively than the current rulers .
only an alliance of conservative leaders and powers ( including a retreat by America from diplomatic radicalism ) , Abdullah believes , can restore some stability to the Middle East .
the award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the United Nations and to its Secretary General , Kofi Annan , is a cause for true celebration everywhere .
but celebrations should never become an excuse for complacency .
yes , the UN has achieved much under Secretary General Annan &apos;s leadership .
but the idea of the United Nations as a uniter of nations remains , in many parts of the world and for many of the world &apos;s most complex problems , more an ideal still to be achieved than a living reality .
some of the most powerful nations in the world still do not see fully cooperating with or participating in UN affairs as in their interest .
beyond states , the world &apos;s many NGOs are growing fast and multiplying in their influence , but without formal rules to define their role in the international system .
their real power , despite Secretary General Annan &apos;s efforts to create a dialogue with them , stands outside the UN framework .
indeed , NGOs often assume tasks for which the current structure of the UN is unsuited or remains far too weak .
to assist them in their tasks , and to assure that the great global issues of the day are addressed in a forum that unites and does not divide , the UN needs to be strengthened in the fields in which NGO &apos;s are working so impressively .
such strengthening can only be achieved by a fundamental reform of the UN &apos;s internal structure .
when the UN was founded in 1945 , the primary objective was to prevent the outbreak of World War III .
so , at its foundation , only one powerful body was introduced , the Security Council on which the world &apos;s great military powers sat .
the agenda of the Security Council was and remains power , and meeting crises , mostly with military means .
