it has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold .
Lately , with gold prices up more than 300 % over the last decade , it is harder than ever .
just last December , fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment , sensibly pointing out gold ’ s risks .
wouldn ’ t you know it ?
since their articles appeared , the price of gold has moved up still further . gold prices even hit a record-high $ 1,300 recently .
last December , many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $ 2,000 .
now , emboldened by continuing appreciation , some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that .
one successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980 ’ s .
since then , the index has climbed above 10,000 .
now that gold has crossed the magic $ 1,000 barrier , why can ’ t it increase ten-fold , too ?
Admittedly , getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems .
after adjusting for inflation , today ’ s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980 .
back then , gold hit $ 850 , or well over $ 2,000 in today ’ s dollars .
but January 1980 was arguably a “ freak peak ” during a period of heightened geo-political instability .
at $ 1,300 , today ’ s price is probably more than double very long-term , inflation-adjusted , average gold prices .
so what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here ?
one answer , of course , is a complete collapse of the US dollar .
with soaring deficits , and a rudderless fiscal policy , one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press .
and if you are really worried about that , gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge .
sure , some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold . but gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances .
in fact , as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises , This Time is Different , cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt , precisely so that its value might be inflated away .
even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s .
so it can happen anywhere .
even so , the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable , so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations .
some have argued instead that gold ’ s long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold .
there is probably some slight truth – and also a certain degree of irony – to this argument .
after all , medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold .
wouldn ’ t it be paradoxical , then , if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more ?
in my view , the most powerful argument to justify today ’ s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East into the global economy .
as legions of new consumers gain purchasing power , demand inevitably rises , driving up the price of scarce commodities .
at the same time , emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves , which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks .
with the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar , gold ’ s appeal has naturally grown .
so , yes , there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today ’ s higher gold price , although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future .
indeed , another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization .
gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements .
after all , gold pays no interest and even costs something to store .
today , with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries , it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds .
but if real interest rates rise significantly , as well they might someday , gold prices could plummet .
most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term , with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance .
it is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends .
yes , gold has had a great run , but so , too , did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago .
if you are a high-net-worth investor , a sovereign wealth fund , or a central bank , it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events .
but , despite gold ’ s heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price , it remains a very risky bet for most of us .
of course , such considerations might have little influence on prices .
what was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today : gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile .
last week Tony Blair , Jacques Chirac , and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin .
they departed pledging to revive Europe &apos;s growth .
we &apos;ve heard that empty promise before .
instead , the European Union needs a new direction .
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain &apos;s engagement with Europe .
it was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960 &apos;s .
a Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973 .
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986 .
so I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union .
but British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states .
faced with a new EU initiative , our traditional response has often been to oppose it , vote against it , lose the vote , then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else .
many Europeans are sick of British vetoes .
so am I .
of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept .
foremost are the four freedoms of the single market ; free movement of goods , services , people and capital .
but a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy , far less a common taxation policy .
allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness .
forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours .
which areas should be applied to every member state , and which should be optional ?
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states .
in areas which serve their national interest , individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co ‑ operate with others .
the Union &apos;s members should form a series of overlapping circles : different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing .
precedents exist for this .
NATO has been flexible since its inception .
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO &apos;s central command .
similar flexibility exists with the Euro , the Schengen Agreement , and the Social Chapter .
these precedents can be extended .
so far , everyone has had to move forward together , with individual countries negotiating specific opt ‑ outs .
but since 1998 , there has been a procedure within the Treaties - called enhanced co ‑ operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member .
instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt ‑ out of a new initiative , those that support it can simply opt ‑ in .
countries that want to integrate further can do so .
they don &apos;t need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them .
in this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations .
I am not talking about a two ‑ speed Europe .
that implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey .
I don &apos;t want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to .
but I don &apos;t want to block their way .
there are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely .
but influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end .
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken .
our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out .
keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro , or hope for its failure .
the European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively .
it should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions , within the EU framework .
it is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution .
we disagree with many of its contents , of course , but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all .
there is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty , and a single entity , whether you call it a state or not , with its own legal personality , deriving its authority from its own constitution .
if this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form , the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood : its own president and foreign minister , its own legal system .
the supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra ‑ national constitution .
that is a radical change , not the mere tidying ‑ up exercise some suggest .
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern .
elected parliaments do not own our liberties .
they safeguard them , and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate .
any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state .
Brussels – Austerity alone cannot solve Europe &apos;s economic and financial crisis .
growth and jobs need to be promoted with equal zeal .
European Union leaders now recognize this : kick-starting growth in 2012 was high on the agenda at the European Council ’ s meeting on January 30 .
but the big question remains : how ?
the need for immediate action is clear .
the eurozone ’ s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011 ; even Germany ’ s shrank .
the new year is looking grim .
France is flat-lining ( as is Britain ) .
Italy and Spain have sunk into deep recession .
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump .
and eurozone unemployment is at record highs , with nearly one in two young people jobless in Spain and Greece .
the economic headwinds are formidable : fiscal austerity , high interest rates outside AAA-rated countries , credit cutting by banks , deleveraging households , weak private-sector investment , and declining exports as the global slowdown undermines demand .
until growth resumes , any tentative financial stabilization will be extremely fragile .
recession will hit banks ’ and governments ’ already-weak balance sheets , increasing pressure for faster deleveraging .
but , while gradual adjustment is essential , faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating : big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown – and thus a vicious downward spiral .
a big new push for growth is therefore vital .
so far , the growth agenda has consisted largely of structural reforms , which are essential for boosting future productivity and flexibility .
the crisis does provide a political opportunity for bold moves on this front in many countries ; but structural reforms generally will not generate growth and jobs immediately ( one exception is permitting shops to open longer ) .
on the contrary , a shakeout of less productive jobs , for example , would at first raise unemployment , increase government outlays , and reduce private spending .
and , because demand is depressed , credit is in short supply , and barriers to enterprise are often high , it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs .
in short , structural reforms alone cannot be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012 .
instead , the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit – such as France , Italy , and Spain ( and the United Kingdom ) – and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands .
the European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks ; now it needs to support the real economy , too .
while official interest rates are only 1 % , solvent sovereigns such as Spain pay more than 5 % to borrow for ten years , while creditworthy businesses in Italy can borrow only at punitive rates , if at all .
so the ECB should do more to unblock the transmission mechanism for monetary policy ; the European Banking Authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9 % ratio ; and , where necessary , national governments should provide guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size businesses .
while improving access to finance is vital , governments also need to do more to boost investment .
they should prioritize measures to make it easier to start a business , lift barriers to venture capital , and introduce temporary 100 % capital allowances to encourage businesses to bring forward investment .
at the EU level , the ( callable ) capital of the European Investment Bank should be greatly increased , as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested in his State of the Union speech last September , so that the EIB can finance a big wave of pan-European investment , notably in infrastructure .
boosting exports is also essential .
deficit countries need to become more competitive , increasing productivity while cutting costs .
a more competitive currency would be welcome : just as the sterling ’ s collapse since 2008 has lifted UK exports , a weaker euro would help Mediterranean economies regain competitiveness for price-sensitive exports .
a fiscal devaluation – slashing payroll taxes and replacing the revenues with a higher VAT – would also help .
surplus countries , too , must do their part , which is in their own interest .
just as China needs to allow the renminbi to rise , so Germany – whose current-account surplus exceeds China &apos;s both as a share of GDP and in absolute terms – needs a higher real exchange rate .
that means that Germans need to earn higher wages , commensurate with their increased productivity , so that they can afford more Greek and Spanish holidays .
if businesses will not oblige , an income-tax cut would do the trick .
that brings us to fiscal policy .
governments that cannot borrow cheaply ( or at all ) from markets have no option but to tighten their belts .
but they should pursue smart consolidation rather than unthinking austerity .
so they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure , while cutting subsidies and transfer payments .
they should also legislate now for future reforms , notably to encourage people to work longer .
last but not least , governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates – 0 % in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany – must play their role in supporting demand .
would it be really be so difficult to see VAT coming down ahead of the German election next year ?
at the onset of the US-led war in Iraq , two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome .
the first contended that overthrowing Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally .
derided by detractors as a new &quot; domino theory , &quot; this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to America &apos;s role in post-WWII Japan .
against the optimism of that &quot; Japan scenario , &quot; pessimists argued that a &quot; Somalia scenario &quot; was more likely .
they staked their claim on the tribal , sectarian , and multiethnic nature of Iraq , which , in the absence of dictatorship , would supposedly incite Iraq &apos;s collapse into a &quot; failed state , &quot; with rampant warlordism , ethnic and religious feuds , and harboring of terrorist organizations .
but the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios , increasingly resembling Afghanistan .
this &quot; Afghan scenario &quot; implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government .
bad as it sounds , this prospect appears to be a &quot; realistic &quot; compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing , unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state .
many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , as well as higher-level Bush administration decisions , seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy were misplaced .
indeed , such hopes were misplaced .
Iraq &apos;s political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy : notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking , the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted , and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community .
on the other hand , much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the &quot; traditional &quot; nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy .
for these analyses are hardly neutral , but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation .
in Iraq , as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds , a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms : grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding ( nationalism , socialism , Islamism ) , versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience .
the frontlines of this war are notions of the individual , cultural identity , civil society , and the nation-state .
the religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated .
but it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it .
nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system , but they are not its sole components .
indeed , the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of &quot; democracy &quot; and &quot; human rights &quot; as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle .
this cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene .
there are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context .
advocates of the notion of &quot; Arab exceptionalism , &quot; which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with &quot; grand narrative &quot; ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world &apos;s patronage-based political order .
the models used in the West , both in political circles and in academia , for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient .
in particular , many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model , reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented &quot; reality &quot; of separate communities .
some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its &quot; genuine &quot; original components : Sunni , Shi`i , and Kurd .
in fact , Iraqi society is more complex than this .
the reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging , but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical , cultural , religious , and political identities of Iraqi individuals .
given the right circumstances , it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its state-to-be .
the fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances .
indeed , the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddam &apos;s dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society .
upon Saddam &apos;s fall , a large &quot; middle ground &quot; existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice .
policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground , opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neo-Ba`athism .
the key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground .
as a result , the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded .
but to treat this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy .
Iraqi democrats must re-assess and develop a clear public strategy .
the CPA , and the world community , must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society .
even if such efforts succeed , the road to a full-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive .
but instead of succumbing to a &quot; Somalia scenario , &quot; dreaming of a &quot; Japan scenario , &quot; or settling for an &quot; Afghanistan scenario , &quot; Iraq may yet become a &quot; scenario &quot; for successful intervention in the 21 st century .
although the EU &apos;s eastward enlargement has not yet happened , the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow : when should the new , predominantly postcommunist , members adopt the euro ?
assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s provisions concerning the EMU - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry .
at the outset , it must be stressed that , in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed .
early entry , otherwise , would be an empty gesture .
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible , but preferable to delay .
by early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM II ) .
assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in 2004 , new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006 .
is this realistic ?
well , most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU .
exports to the Union have soared since 1991 , when the collapse of the Soviet-era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets .
most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece , Portugal , and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU .
progress on disinflation is similarly impressive .
annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5 % - not much higher than in many EU countries , and lower than in The Netherlands last year .
as with structural convergence , EU candidates already outperform Spain , Portugal , and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut .
nor is there much risk of large , future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized .
theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows .
the culprit in this pessimistic view is the so-called &quot; Balassa-Samuelson &quot; effect : rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates &apos; tradable sectors - export manufacturing , for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies , including in non-tradable sectors like services .
this overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average .
the Balassa-Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece , Spain and Portugal .
but as empirical research prepared by the CEC5 National Banks estimates , its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-2 % .
with the Balassa-Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation , the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5 % of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the EU - is within reach .
but is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership ?
from the standpoint of current member states , would admitting Hungary , Latvia , Poland , or Slovakia , sooner rather than later , drag down the euro as many fear ?
fears that extending EMU to new states &quot; too soon &quot; would undermine the euro &apos;s external exchange rate are irrational .
if all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time , they will together account for a mere 6 % of its total GDP .
so any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error .
delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information .
but a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise .
equally , the transition period is already turbulent , with convergence-driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries , including Poland , the Czech Republic , and Hungary .
indeed , capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II - a 15 % fluctuation band either side of a central parity .
some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves .
the benefit is simple : ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility , as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro .
this would help keep the candidates &apos; economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels .
this is an exceptionally weak argument , and a politically suspect one , too .
as European Central Bank data shows , average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44 % of the eurozone level .
the size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry , probably lasting several decades .
more important , long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed ( EMU ) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms .
a few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms .
in almost all candidates , further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation , more flexible labor markets , and completion of privatization .
delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms .
any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear .
early adoption , by contrast , would be more conducive to these reforms , and thus to real convergence .
success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency , reduced transaction costs , and a solid macroeconomic framework .
this strategy , not one of deferred entry , promises the most for both the EU &apos;s current and its future members .
Paris – As the economic crisis deepens and widens , the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening .
at the start of the crisis , many people likened it to 1982 or 1973 , which was reassuring , because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns .
today , the mood is much grimmer , with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound , even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional .
the tendency is either excessive restraint ( Europe ) or a diffusion of the effort ( the United States ) .
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro , whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms .
for geo-strategists , however , the year that naturally comes to mind , in both politics and economics , is 1989 .
of course , the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall .
indeed , on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis : the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism .
yet 2008-2009 , like 1989 , may very well correspond to an epochal change , whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades .
the end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points .
and what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989 , including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist , if not xenophobic , tendencies .
in 1989 , liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc .
for many of his supporters , it was President Ronald Reagan who , with his deliberate escalation of the arms race , pushed the Soviet economy to the brink , thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets .
of course , there are obvious differences between 1989 and now .
first , and perhaps above all , the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity .
by contrast , 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity , but with China substituting for the Soviet Union .
second , whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989 , it is difficult in 2009 , with the spread of the global crisis , to distinguish winners from losers .
everyone seems to be a loser , even if some are more affected than others .
yet , history is unfair , and the US , despite its greater responsibility for today ’ s global crisis , may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass .
in better shape , but not alone .
as a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT , I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes .
one senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe .
from the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard , Asians – Chinese and Indians , in particular – are everywhere , like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC : full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much , and whom they would overcome in the coming decades .
but before this new order appears , the world may be faced with spreading disorder , if not outright chaos .
what , for example , will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries ?
when the rich get less rich , the poor get poorer .
and what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “ European dream ” and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe ’ s supposedly open countries ?
the consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers , including me , would have assumed .
we can only hope that , in the end , the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intuitively and in our historical reflexes – feel them to be .
Moscow – Most people who know of me think of me as an information-technology expert , someone who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet start-ups .
in fact , my formal residence is in New York City , but I am about to spend most of the next five months in Russia , training to be a cosmonaut in Star City , just outside Moscow .
it all came about in a number of ways .
first of all , as a kid , I just assumed that I would go to the moon , without having to do much in particular to make it happen .
I just took it for granted that , by the time I was , say , 40 , space travel would be a common thing .
my father was involved with the United States space program , and we had some moon rocks at home , so I thought it was no big deal .
then I got distracted for about 40 years .
a few years ago , however , I started paying attention to space again .
a lot of people I knew in the IT industry were doing the same : Elon Musk , a co-founder of PayPal , founded Space-X ; Jeff Bezos of Amazon started a spacecraft company called Blue Origin ; Jeff Greason , a senior manager at Intel , started XCOR Aerospace ( in which I ’ m an investor ) .
in 2005 , the last year I held my PC Forum conference for IT entrepreneurs , I started a conference called Flight School for entrepreneurs in space and private aviation .
meanwhile , in about 2005 , I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government about its IT policy .
one of the group was Mark Shuttleworth , founder of Thawte ( sold to VeriSign ) , who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second “ space tourist . ”
one evening , the group sat around a campfire as the sun set , and around 50 African schoolchildren were bussed in .
altogether , there were about 100 of us , President Mbeki included , around a roaring fire .
once it was dark , a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space .
he gave a fascinating talk about his adventures , complete with clips of him floating around , catching bubbles in his mouth , and so on .
the kids loved it , and I &apos;m sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science .
eventually , I invested in Space Adventures , the company that organized Shuttleworth ’ s trip into space .
later , I went on a tour that they organized to watch the launch of Charles Simonyi , the fifth ( and soon seventh ) space tourist , from Baikonur in Kazakhstan .
( Simonyi wrote the Microsoft Word program , and now has another start-up , Intentional Software , and a foundation , as well as a Web site , CharlesinSpace.org. )
soon after , I started casually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team .
yes , I would love to actually go , but the trip to space costs $ 35 to $ 40 million , whereas backup training costs “ only ” $ 3 million .
so I had vague thoughts that I might go into space sometime in 2011 - the year that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is ( very ) tentatively slated to go .
space Adventures was pushing for 2009 , but I was pretty busy .
then something happened last spring : my sister Emily discovered that she had cancer and had a double mastectomy .
( she is doing well now and , in fact , just won a mini-marathon . )
a couple of weeks later , I was faced with one of those conflicts : a board meeting here , a conference there , another opportunity at the same time somewhere else . “ Aaagh , ” I thought , “ if only I had a double mastectomy : I could cancel all these things and no one would complain ! ”

good grief ! I realized my priorities were all out of whack . so in some odd way , this sabbatical in Russia is my alternative to a double mastectomy – a positive one , to be sure , but the same kind of reset-button experience .
it is also the answer to another question I hear a lot because of my work on human genetics through 23andMe ( www.23andme.com ) and the Personal Genome Project ( www.personalgenome.org ) : if you learned you had a high chance of developing Alzheimer ’ s in a few years , what would you do ?
why , I ’ d go train to be a cosmonaut , of course ! and why wait to find out I may get Alzheimer ’ s ? next month , I will write about what training to go into space actually involves .
five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington , “ 9 / 11 ” is no longer a mere date .
it has entered the history books as the beginning of something new , a new era perhaps , but in any case a time of change .
the terrorist bombings in Madrid and London and elsewhere will also be remembered ; but it is “ 9 / 11 ” that has become the catchphrase , almost like “ August 1914 . ”
but was it really a war that started on September 11 , 2001 ?
not all are happy about this American notion .
during the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK , successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged . “ War ” would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies , in a sense as equals in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement .
this is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts , which are more correctly described as criminal .
by calling them war – and naming an opponent , usually al-Qaeda and its leader , Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that , before the 9 / 11 attacks , would have been unacceptable in any free country .
most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “ USA Patriot Act . ”
though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations , the Patriot Act ’ s overall effect was to erode the great pillars of liberty , such as habeas corpus , the right to recourse to an independent court whenever the state deprives an individual of his freedom .
from an early date , the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba became the symbol of something unheard of : the arrest without trial of “ illegal combatants ” who are deprived of all human rights .
the world now wonders how many more of these non-human humans are there in how many places .
for everyone else , a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights . controls at borders have become an ordeal for many , and police persecution now burdens quite a few .
a climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously , notably for Muslims .
such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted .
on the contrary , by and large it was the critics , not the supporters , of these measures who found themselves in trouble .
in Britain , where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely , the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory .
Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom .
in other words , liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives , but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define .
this is the beginning of a new authoritarianism .
the problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism , though in many it has not become quite as specific .
in most countries of continental Europe , “ 9 / 11 ” has remained an American date .
there is even a debate – and indeed some evidence – concerning the question of whether involvement in the “ war against terrorism ” has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts .
Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible .
this stance , however , has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages , too : angst .
a diffuse anxiety is gaining ground .
people feel uneasy and worried , especially when traveling .
any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism .
thus , 9 / 11 has meant , directly or indirectly , a great shock , both psychologically and to our political systems .
while terrorism is fought in the name of democracy , the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy , owing to official legislation and popular angst .
one of the worrying features of the 9 / 11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators ’ resentment of the West and its ways .
but the West ’ s key features , democracy and the rule of law , have taken a far more severe battering at the hands of their defenders than by their attackers .
two steps , above all , are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9 / 11 .
first , we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary .
some of today ’ s restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset clauses restricting their validity ; all such rules should be re-examined by parliaments regularly .
second , and more importantly , our leaders must seek to calm , rather than exploit , public anxiety .
the terrorists with whom we are currently at “ war ” cannot win , because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy .
that is all the more reason for democrats to stand tall in defending our values – first and foremost by acting in accordance with them .
new YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes , flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center , hit the Pentagon with a third , and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission .
in a matter of hours , more than 3,000 innocent people , mostly Americans , but also people from 115 other countries , had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them .
September 11 , 2001 , was a terrible tragedy by any measure , but it was not a historical turning point .
it did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed , or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace .
on the contrary , 9 / 11 has not been replicated .
despite the attention devoted to the “ Global War on Terrorism , ” the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies , globalization , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the political upheavals in the Middle East .
as for the future , it is much more likely to be defined by the United States ’ need to put its economic house in order ; China ’ s trajectory within and beyond its borders ; and the ability of the world ’ s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth , stemming the spread of nuclear weapons , and meeting energy and environmental challenges .
it is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world .
terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best .
they can destroy but not create .
it is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda .
Moreover , measures have been implemented to push back , successfully , against terrorists .
intelligence assets have been redirected .
borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient .
international cooperation has increased markedly , in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area .
military force has played a role as well .
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power .
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad .
Drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists , including many of the most important leaders .
weak governments can be made stronger ; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable .
but progress is not to be confused with victory .
terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease .
there will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men , women , and children in pursuit of political goals .
indeed , terrorists are advancing in some areas .
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world ’ s other most dangerous terrorists .
a mixture of instability , government weakness , and ideology in countries such as Yemen , Libya , Somalia , and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize , train , and mount operations – much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago .
new groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones .
there is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism .
we have seen it in Great Britain and the US .
the Internet , one of the great inventions of the modern Western world , has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world .
the question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today : “ Are we capturing , killing , or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting , training , and deploying against us ? ”
all things being equal , we probably are . but even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives , money , and making open societies less so .
what is to be done ?
Alas , there is no single or silver bullet .
the establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state , any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India .
reducing unemployment is desirable , of course , but many terrorists do not come from poverty .
helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse , but this is easier said than done .
of course , we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so .
but what may be most important , particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities , is to end any acceptance of terrorism .
the Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do – before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 – is an example of just this .
only when more parents , teachers , and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police .
terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency .
the world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol .
the enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty , due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009 .
campaigners will push for tough and far-reaching policies , but strong resistance will continue from countries concerned about their economic vitality .
the new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts , because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation , mitigation , and research efforts .
new research that my colleagues and I undertook for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge , but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons .
first , we now know that adaptation will be essential , because temperatures will rise by another 0.6 ° C by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow .
we also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe .
in some areas , modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse and / or irrigation remains viable .
even with 0.6 ° C warming , however , Africa and South Asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and , eventually , increased vulnerability to infectious disease .
these impacts will clearly hit the planet ’ s worst-off inhabitants hardest : the “ bottom billion ” who already bear the heaviest burden of disease , poverty , conflict and malnutrition . &amp; # 160 ;
ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge .
long-term development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens ’ health , but in the meantime the planet ’ s poorest people will need help from the rich .
our analysis investigated , for example , the merits of more targeted policies for the near term : purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral re-hydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change .
the goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming .
benefits would appear almost immediately , but would dissipate over time as economies developed .
even as development improves conditions , however , reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe .
since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world , thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere .
but we found that mitigationalone did not meet a standard cost-benefit test .
we allowed specified annual costs of climate policy to grow in proportion with global GDP through 2100 from an initial annual benchmark of $ 18 billion .
the discounted cost of the resulting stream of fixed annual costs totaled $ 800 billion , but damages avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $ 685 billion .
the Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
we allocated $ 50 billion to research into greener technology , so that only $ 750 billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation .
the gap between the cost of carbon-free and carbon-emitting technology fell , and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective .
as a result , the research and development program essentially paid for itself , and total discounted benefits for the $ 800 billion investment climbed to more than $ 2.1 trillion . &amp; # 160 ;
ensuring that research and development is part of the world ’ s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century .
but these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would “ come onboard . ”
Optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would , for example , increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three .
expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages , even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities , which would push in the opposite direction .
fighting climate change can be a sound investment , even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to “ solve ” the problem .
to make a real difference , especially in the near term , the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestering technology , which in turn requires designing and exploiting market-based incentives .
STOCKHOLM – One year after the war in Georgia of last August , pushing the “ reset ” button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays .
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to “ reset ” strained United States-Russian ties .
the European Union , though not in need of a “ reset ” because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors , is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations .
when the EU launched its new “ Eastern Partnership ” in May , the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union ’ s six immediate eastern neighbors – Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia , Moldova , and Ukraine .
the global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU ’ s eastern neighborhood an urgent need .
equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU .
the Eastern Partnership – originating from a Polish / Swedish initiative – offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas .
in trade and economic relations , it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive free-trade areas between the EU and the partner countries .
it confirms full visa liberalization as a long-term goal ( with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime ) , promises enhanced cooperation on energy security , diversification , and efficiency , and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas .
Sweden ’ s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts .
however , it comes at a time when the Union ’ s eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges , with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard .
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade , severely undermining its steel industry .
Georgia ’ s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment , for which there is hardly any appetite today .
partner countries that are less integrated into the global market , such as Moldova , have seen the crisis arrive more slowly , but the real effect might be equally as bad , and they are likely to recover more slowly .
the Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis .
but it can provide a political framework and institution-building support to improve the deficiencies that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis : imperfect market economies , weak state institutions , and continued corruption .
the Eastern Partnership ’ s offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power .
the other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political .
in most of these countries , democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country ’ s stability .
the Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law .
political association with the EU , and the process of integration under this Partnership , will promote reforms in these key areas .
the Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work – the nuts and bolts – of the Partnership .
the establishment of “ Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs , ” designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country , should take place before the year ’ s end .
some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well , and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed .
here , Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs , which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs , but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
the Swedish Presidency , together with the European Commission , intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn .
we hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation , as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries .
at the end of the year , a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead .
the Eastern Partnership is about EU integration , about the six countries moving closer to the EU ’ s values , legislation , and ways of working , and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence .
in Russia , there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it .
but this , of course , is untrue .
on the contrary , Russia , like Turkey , will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership ’ s multilateral dimensions .
the Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing .
nevertheless , it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform – a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region .
Paris – “ Let ’ s engage Russia if we can , but contain it if we must . ” These two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid-1990 ’ s .
since then , Russia may have changed dramatically , but not our questions about it .
what do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture , which is European , and its political system , which is becoming increasingly “ Asian , ” at least in the bad old sense of “ Oriental despotism ” ?
should the best answer to the return of Russia ’ s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world ’ s new maverick ?
or is a latter-day Yalta Conference , aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe , necessary ?
could the answer be a bit of both ?
if Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon , or reverting to Soviet form – shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and re-conquest – what is needed is not the “ league of democracies ” advocated by some conservatives in America .
what is needed , instead , is a “ stability league ” that includes prominent actors like China , India , and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in “ rocking the boat ” of the international system .
such a strategy implies , first of all , a solid partnership with China , not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy , but because it is a status-quo power .
such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran , and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO .
the message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear . “ Do not fool yourself .
nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere ; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment .
Europe may be weak and divided , America may no longer be what it was , but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas , you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers .
China is ; you are not . ”
but the containment argument fails , because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner .
more importantly , rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia ’ s great power pretensions too seriously .
for example , many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe , but no longer for the world .
at the Cold War ’ s end , Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union .
today , the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia .
the other alternative to a rebirth of “ containment ” would consist in accepting the Russian argument , or more precisely , Russian “ emotions . ”
it would mean saying , in effect , “ We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years .
from NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo , we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests .
let ’ s sit down together like Churchill , Roosevelt , and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twenty-first-century map of Europe .
what do you want back ?
what do we keep ? ”
this approach might recognize Russia ’ s droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus .
indeed , while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s France , which currently holds the EU presidency , Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia ’ s dismemberment .
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
the West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president ’ s irresponsible behavior .
as for Ukraine , it may one day become part of the European Union , but its future is not in NATO .
yet , between all-out containment , which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic , and accommodation which borders on appeasement , which would be dangerous for Europe ’ s future , a third way , based on a few firm principles , must be found .
these principles are clear .
first , Ukraine ’ s territorial integrity is not negotiable .
this has been said many times , but repetition does not diminish its importance .
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state ; Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire .
second , even if the West condemns Georgia ’ s irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia ’ s sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its ex-imperial territories , the Kremlin ’ s shameless brutality is unacceptable .
after all , this is Europe more than six decades after World War II , and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
the use of force to settle scores and impose one nation ’ s will upon another cannot be accepted passively .
in the short term , time may be on Russia ’ s side .
in the long run – economically , demographically , politically , strategically – time is on “ our ” side , if we stick to our values and our principles .
the drubbing that many governments suffered in the recent elections to the European Union Parliament places them in a difficult position as they maneuver ahead of this week &apos;s EU Summit .
only an incurable optimist can hope that the summit will bring glory to any of them .
the summit has two purposes : to finalize the text of a new EU Constitution , and to appoint the next President of the Commission .
these negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box , together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states .
the problem for Europe &apos;s leaders is that their own repudiation by voters does not necessarily carry the same message as the rise of the Euroskeptic parties .
the record slump in the vote for Gerhard Schröder &apos;s governing Social Democrats in Germany has little to do with his policy towards Europe , but a great deal to do with the perceived failure of his economic policies - and the persistence of low growth and high unemployment - at home .
despite nationalist parties &apos; success in France , the same is true of the setback for President Jacques Chirac &apos;s centre-right party .
in Britain , by contrast , where the economy is strong and unemployment low , the main factor behind the collapse in the vote for the governing Labor Party has been anger with Tony Blair &apos;s determination to go to war in Iraq beside George Bush .
nevertheless , the rise of Euroskeptic parties , in a number of countries including Britain , France , Belgium , Poland , and the Czech Republic , has worrying implications for a summit meeting whose purpose is to take European integration a small but unmistakable step forward .
in Britain , in particular , the spectacular surge of the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) can only strengthen the government &apos;s long-standing latent Euroskepticism .
the proposed constitution will contain a Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is intended to enhance the political and moral legitimacy of the EU .
but will it really enhance the rights of EU citizens ?
or , as the British government insists , will it merely be a declaratory document that only describes rights already existing under national legislation in the member states .
the draft constitution would enhance the policymaking powers of the Union , with a bit more majority voting in the Council of Ministers , and a stronger role for the European Parliament .
but , despite Tony Blair &apos;s one-time declaration that he would take Britain &quot; into the heart of Europe , &quot; he remains viscerally opposed to the prospect of further integration , and he will resist any new encroachment on British sovereignty in his &quot; red line &quot; areas of tax , foreign policy , and EU budget finance .
Blair &apos;s Euroskepticism is understandable insofar as it chimes with the British mood .
opinion polls consistently show that British voters are unenthusiastic about the EU , and the picture is confirmed by the latest Eurobarometer poll , conducted throughout the Union for the Commission - but before the recent enlargement from 15 to 25 member states .
one question always asked in this poll is whether voters tend to trust or mistrust different institutions , such as national parliaments , national governments , and the European Union .
overall , the general level of trust in the European Union is not high : only 41 % of voters tend to trust the EU , whereas 42 % tend not to trust it .
but in Britain , the figures are dramatically different : only 19 % trust the EU , while 55 % distrust it .
by contrast , the European Parliament has a better reputation than the EU as a whole : the average EU-wide level of trust in the European Parliament is 54 % , whereas in Britain it is 30 % .
across the EU , 48 % think EU membership is a good thing ; in Britain , this figure falls to 29 % .
on virtually every question , British voters are less enthusiastic about the EU than voters in any other country .
one might think that Britons &apos; aversion to the EU would be reflected in support for , and pride in , their national institutions .
not so .
British trust in the European Parliament may stand at only 30 % ; but trust in the Westminster Parliament is much lower , at only 19 % - the lowest figure in the EU .
trust in the national government is a bit higher , but still only 25 % , while trust in national political parties is only 10 % .
both figures are , again , the lowest in the EU .
voters in other states have more confidence in EU institutions , but their opinion of their own institutions is also low .
in France , 57 % trust the European Parliament , but only 29 % trust the French parliament ; while the corresponding figures for Germany are 51 % and 23 % .
but the puzzle in the poll is that , even if Europe &apos;s voters are unenthusiastic about the EU and its existing institutions as they stand now , 65 % of them would support a common foreign policy for Europe , and 72 % would support a common defense and security policy ; even in Britain , there is 52 % support for the idea of a common defense policy .
this may be a reaction to the American-led war in Iraq ; but Tony Blair will exclude it precisely for that reason , and a common European defense policy without Britain makes little sense .
the predicament for Europe &apos;s leaders at this week &apos;s summit is that they stand at the cusp of an unstable process of European integration .
with the accession of 10 new members , the EU must become more integrated if it is to function .
but it is not at all clear that those governments that would normally support more integration can sell it to their disillusioned electorates .
Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the new EU constitution , which he cannot possibly win .
the central question will be whether Europe &apos;s &quot; leaders &quot; deliberately play for failure , in the hope that the problem will go away .
Washington , DC – The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America ’ s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending , thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States .
but the agreement has three major flaws .
two of them offset each other , but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years : economic growth .
the first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed : coming as they do when the US economy is weak , they risk triggering another recession .
the measure ’ s second shortcoming , however , is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest .
while the legislation does too little to address America ’ s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits , the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited .
the third and most damaging flaw , however , is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places .
because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving , intact , America ’ s principal welfare programs for senior citizens , Social Security and Medicare , the legislation does not touch either of them .
these programs ’ costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation – those born between 1946 and 1964 – retires and collects benefits , accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead .
and , because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes , any time , under any circumstances , the bill does not rely at all on tax increases – not even for the wealthiest Americans – for the deficit reduction that it provides .
all of the spending cuts come from the “ discretionary ” part of the federal budget , which excludes Social Security , Medicare , the Medicaid program for the poor , and interest on the national debt .
that leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut , and much of that goes to the defense budget , which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future .
so the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the “ discretionary non-defense ” part of the federal budget , which is only about 10 % of it .
this is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead .
worse yet , discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth – and economic growth is indispensable for America ’ s future prosperity and global standing .
growth is , in the first place , the best way to reduce the country ’ s budget deficits .
the higher the growth rate , the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates ; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits .
Moreover , economic growth is necessary to keep the promise – enormously important to individual Americans – that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one , the popular term for which is “ the American dream . ”
just as important for non-Americans , only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world , which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe , East Asia , and the Middle East .
as Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us : how America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back , a crucial factor in America &apos;s economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership , which dates back to the founding of the country , that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation .
that partnership has five components : wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills ; investment in infrastructure – roads , power plants , and ports – that supports commerce ; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products ; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America ’ s borders ; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth .
the first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money , and that money is included in the “ discretionary non-defense ” part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation .
cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term , with negative consequences both at home and abroad .
reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education , infrastructure , and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers .
most of the weight will remain , and one ’ s life prospects will have worsened significantly .
reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do , but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way .
unless more deficit reduction , which is inevitable , comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues , and less from programs vital for economic growth , the result will be a poorer , weaker US – and a more uncertain , if not unstable , world .
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union &apos;s executive .
Britain , France , and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states .
what &apos;s the ordinary European to think ?
Europe &apos;s citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels .
mountains of detail obscure problems ; sterile , misleading national discussions that pit &quot; Euroskeptics &quot; against &quot; Europhiles &quot; muster sound and fury but clarify nothing .
so complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcasters have abandoned reporting about the Convention .
EU citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question : how should governmental functions be divided between the EU and its member nations ?
to answer this , we need to grasp government &apos;s true purpose .
government should provide citizens with public goods : collective defense , legislation and regulation , enforcement of the rule of law .
these can be provided at different levels : local , regional , national , or supranational government , i.e. , the EU .
but what is the right level ?
in some areas , decentralization works because it recognizes diverse local or national communities .
however , local decisions often have repercussions on citizens in other communities .
so certain services should be allocated to a broader geographic unit because they have externalities ( that is , interdependence of effects ) .
Europe &apos;s allocation of governmental powers should be based on the principle that institutions carry out only those activities with clear economies of scale and where differences of opinion are modest .
the lower a government activity &apos;s externalities , the more it should be localized .
low externalities imply limited benefits to be gained from centralization ; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high .
the euro , for example , delivers clear advantages of scale by favoring international commerce and avoiding negative externalities .
no longer can the lira be devalued to favor Italian exports to the detriment of the French , followed by a French reaction , etc .
although the imperfectly synchronized economic cycles of EU members causes friction over monetary and exchange rate policy , the euro &apos;s benefits outweigh the costs of diversity .
in educational policy , however , to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale .
cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance .
it would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level .
of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities , two stand out : the common market and competition ; and foreign policy and defense .
the former covers antitrust , trade , and the common currency .
some think that fiscal policies - from the structure of taxation to welfare , to budget balances - should also be harmonized .
but national preferences are diverse , and if mechanically imposed , fiscal centralization might incite resistance .
nor do centralized fiscal policies have any real raison d &apos;être from a constitutional point of view .
the US Constitution , for example , does not prescribe balanced budgets for the states .
only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmonization justified : prohibitions , say , on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition , impeding commerce , or restricting the movement of capital .
foreign policy and defense belong , par excellence , at government &apos;s apex .
there are clear externalities and economies of scale .
it would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas .
much the same is true in Europe .
the addition of new EU members implies that more internal differences will occur , which means that fewer centralized policies are justified .
these considerations suggest a series of principles for the Convention to consider :
the EU Constitution should establish unequivocally which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to member countries .
when in doubt , the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain supreme ;
European-level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets , including competition , commercial , and monetary policies ;
fiscal policy should remain largely decentralized , save for a few exceptions ;
foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence , to be delegated to Europe at a proper time ;
the creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies .
so &quot; No centralization without representation . &quot;
today &apos;s EU diverges enormously from these principles ( see table ) , as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture , which represents 2 % of European GDP , accounts for 40 % of EU expenditures .
activities of EU Institutions ( percent of total )

Europe faces an historic opportunity .
America &apos;s founding fathers wrote a Constitution that has lasted over 200 years .
members of the European Convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse society-and thus a more daunting constitutional challenge .
but they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight .
Beijing – Before July 2007 , most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth .
it was argued that the United States ’ rising net foreign debt-to-GDP ratio – the result of chronic current-account deficits – would put a sharp brake on capital inflows , in turn weakening the dollar , driving up interest rates , and plunging the US economy into crisis .
but this scenario failed to materialize .
instead , the crisis stemmed from the US sub-prime debacle , which quickly dragged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930 ’ s .
most economists failed to foresee the economic dynamics that actually led to the crisis , because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt .
instead , they focused exclusively on US foreign debt , ignoring household debt ( mortgage and consumer debt ) , public debt , business debt , and financial debt .
in particular , they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt .
in 2007 , the mortgage and consumer debt-to-GDP ratio was more than 90 % , compared to 24 % for net foreign debt .
of course , the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability .
but all parts of a country ’ s total debt and how it is financed are interconnected .
this means two things .
first , funds from different sources of finance are interchangeable to a certain degree : deficiency of funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components .
second , troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components .
after the subprime crisis erupted , mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default .
the fall in US total debt , and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds , led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009 , disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke ’ s claim that the deficit was caused by a global “ saving glut . ”
indeed , America ’ s current-account position strengthened despite the dollar ’ s appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand .
unfortunately , as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings , the US economy , driven by debt and consumption , slid into recession .
to offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth , the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies .
now , with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention , the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again .
sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability , and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment .
the dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt .
the most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness .
but where will increased competitiveness come from ?
devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run , but it is not a solution .
because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities , devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America ’ s budget deficit .
if foreign financing is not forthcoming , yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession .
in the long run , America ’ s growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation .
only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate .
but neither improved competitiveness , nor reduction of total debt , can be achieved overnight .
in the short run , the US current-account deficit will remain , regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses .
thus , China ’ s continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability .
given that America benefits mightily from China ’ s purchases of US government securities , it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral current-account deficit .
it is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus , given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future .
the good news is that , following President Hu Jintao ’ s recent visit to Washington , both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current-account balance .
that augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances , which would certainly benefit the global economy .
Hong KONG – A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967 , when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades .
Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated , rebuilt by the German peoples &apos; hard work and sacrifice to unify the country , and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking ( INET ) , which I was there to attend .
the conference ’ s theme was “ Paradigm Lost , ” with more than 300 economists , political scientists , systems analysts , and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality , rising unemployment , global financial disarray , and climate change .
almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken , but there was no agreement on what can replace it .
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures – political , economic , social , and intellectual .
the global financial crisis , which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereign-debt ( and banking ) crisis , has raised questions that we cannot answer , owing to over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge .
and yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple , overarching theory to explain complex economic , technological , demographic , and environmental shifts .
in particular , the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic .
deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles ( the rule ) and the cause .
by inductive reasoning , if we know the cause and effects , we can infer the principles .
Eastern thinking , by contrast , has been abductive , moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps .
abductive inference is pragmatic , looking only at outcomes , guessing at the rule , and identifying the cause .
like history , social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time .
free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists ( many from Scotland ) , who migrated and colonized territories , allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption .
European continental thinking , responding to urbanization and the need for social order , emphasized institutional analysis of political economy .
thus , the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics , moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty .
this “ predetermined equilibrium ” thinking – reflected in the view that markets always self-correct – led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression , when John Maynard Keynes ’ s argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction .
by the 1970 ’ s , the neoclassical general-equilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that “ finance is a veil , ” thereby becoming blind to financial markets ’ destabilizing effects .
economists like Hyman Minsky , who tried to correct this , were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession ’ s push for free markets and minimal government intervention .
but then technology , demographics , and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee .
even as the world ’ s advanced countries over-consumed through leveraging from derivative finance , four billion of the world ’ s seven billion people began moving to middle-income status , making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability .
new thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes , as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world .
a change of mindset is needed not just in the West , but also in the East .
in 1987 , the historian Ray Huang explained it for China :
“ As the world enters the modern era , most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce . … This is easier said than done .
the renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers , and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them .
comprehensive destruction is often the order ; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion . ”
using this macro-historical framework , we can see Japanese deflation , European debt , and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new , multipolar global system .
we are witnessing simultaneous global convergence ( the narrowing of income , wealth , and knowledge gaps between countries ) and local divergence ( widening income , wealth , and knowledge gaps within countries ) .
adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve .
as the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it : “ Security and justice require centralized governmental control , which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective .
progress , on the contrary , requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order . ”
a new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called “ creative destruction ” is under way : even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity , credit to business and households is shrinking .
we live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation ; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality ; and of technological advancement and resource depletion .
meanwhile , existing political systems promise good jobs , sound governance , a sustainable environment , and social harmony without sacrifice – a paradise of self-interested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations .
we cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money .
sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the have-nots .
the Washington Consensus of free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago .
the INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity .
Europe could use it .
to many , myself included , NATO &apos;s enlargement to take in , among others , the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true .
when the idea was first floated some 10 years ago , expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people .
until recently , Russia &apos;s robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle , because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called &quot; near abroad &quot; as a zone of special interest and influence .
NATO &apos;s enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country &apos;s &quot; zone . &quot;
it assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors ( Hitler &apos;s Reich and Stalin &apos;s USSR ) , which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated .
by putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics , Europe is made a safer place , and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire .
expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO &apos;s political values , including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities .
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement .
rightly so : enlargement of NATO is not an &quot; expansion &quot; that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms .
on the contrary , expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union .
the civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law , due in no small part to NATO demands .
those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia , Europe , and America now work out their disagreements .
indeed , enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad .
this small piece of Russia , with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea , is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania , two future members of the EU .
this could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper .
a deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime .
this , in turn , created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia .
when the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month , the conclusion is clear : Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in , thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002 .
but this is no cause for complacency .
for the really hard work is only now beginning : dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring , as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms , in particular Russia .
relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety .
the common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly .
we need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights .
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations .
the first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave .
the next hurdle is to support Kalingrad &apos;s fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures .
this calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow .
in a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU , where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea .
such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself .
only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams .
but determination and political will has now made the dreams come true .
now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe .
in 1977 , when I served in President Jimmy Carter &apos;s State Department , I was sent to India to dissuade that country &apos;s leaders from developing a nuclear bomb .
my hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China .
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe .
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology .
so far as we know , its leaders have kept their word .
but revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan , the father of Pakistan &apos;s bomb , confirm the danger I predicted back then .
some call Khan &apos;s network an effort to spread an &quot; Islamic bomb , &quot; but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran , it might better be termed a corrupt bomb .
as events in Pakistan illustrate , the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence .
rather , it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons .
that makes everyone less safe .
any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi , Tokyo , Paris , or any city they chose .
now the world &apos;s attention is focussed on Iran , one recipient of Pakistani technology , as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal .
according to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August , and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities .
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy , but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium .
last October , Mohamed El Baradei , the head of the IAEA , announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures .
in addition , after visits by the French , British , and German foreign ministers , Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program .
now it hints that it may resume enrichment , and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA .
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty , it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes .
correct , because the NPT was born with a loophole .
even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections , it can legally accumulate enriched uranium ( or reprocessed plutonium ) under the guise of a peaceful energy program , and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice .
if Iran did this , it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region , but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide .
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons .
the answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others .
for these reasons , President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable .
however , America &apos;s unilateral options are limited .
not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq , but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility , making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions .
Fortunately , there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent .
in the mid-1970 &apos;s , many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities .
realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime , countries as diverse as the Soviet Union , France , Germany , and Japan formed a &quot; Nuclear Suppliers Group &quot; that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities .
that plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it .
today , such countries should join together to offer Iran ( and others ) a deal .
countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel .
for example , Russia , which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr , should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor &apos;s spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing .
this deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council .
the Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace , and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions .
such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle .
the pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear .
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran &apos;s nuclear program .
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services .
it is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle .
it is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan .

new YORK – The G-8 ’ s $ 20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture , launched at the group ’ s recent summit in L ’ Aquila , Italy , is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty .
with serious management of the new funds , food production in Africa will soar .
indeed , the new initiative , combined with others in health , education , and infrastructure , could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals , the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty , disease , and hunger by half by 2015 .
during 2002-2006 , I led the United Nations Millennium Project , which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
one cornerstone of the project was “ smallholder farmers , ” meaning peasant farm families in Africa , Latin America , and Asia – working farms of around one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) or less .
these are some of the poorest households in the world , and , ironically , some of the hungriest as well , despite being food producers .
they are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds , fertilizer , irrigation equipment , and other tools needed to increase productivity .
as a result , their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence .
their poverty causes low farm productivity , and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty .
it ’ s a vicious circle , technically known as a poverty trap .

the UN Millennium Project ’ s Hunger Task Force , led by two world-leading scientists , M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez , examined how to break this vicious circle .
the Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers , in the form of agricultural inputs . the Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose . drawing on that work and related scientific findings , Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution , based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries .
many of us , notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , have worked hard to make this possible , with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food , financial , and energy crises of the past two years .
the G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort , and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama , Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero , Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , World Bank President Robert Zoellick , European Commissioner Louis Michel , European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman , and others .
now the key is to make this effort work .
the lessons of history are clear .
getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices ( or even free in some cases ) will make a lasting difference .
not only will food yields rise in the short term , but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets : cash balances , soil nutrients , farm animals , and their children ’ s health and education .
that boost in assets will , in turn , enable local credit markets , such as micro-finance , to begin operating .
farmers will be able to buy inputs , either out of their own cash , or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness .
a consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders , but obstacles remain .
perhaps the main risk is that the “ aid bureaucracies ” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $ 20 billion , so that much of it gets taken up by meetings , expert consultations , overhead , reports , and further meetings . “ Partnerships ” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves , merely delaying real action .
if donor governments really want results , they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places , the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) in Rome .
one or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars .
governments in hunger-stricken regions , especially Africa , would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds , fertilizer , irrigation , farm tools , storage silos , and local advice to impoverished farmers .
an independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence .
assuming that a plan passes muster , the money to support it would quickly be disbursed .
afterward , each national program would be monitored , audited , and evaluated .
this approach is straightforward , efficient , accountable , and scientifically sound .
two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach : the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations , which successfully gets immunizations to young children , and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria , which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases .
both have saved millions of lives during the past decade , and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance .
not surprisingly , many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach .
all too often , the fight is about turf , rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor .
Obama , Rudd , Zapatero , and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works .
the bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed : in the soil tilled by the world ’ s poorest farm families .
new YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Alerted by a telephone call , a policeman arrived smartly on the scene .
he saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out .
the man refused .
he was then told to identify himself .
the man , still refusing to step out , said he was a Harvard professor , showed his ID , and warned the cop not to mess with him .
he said something about black men in America being singled out , and asked the cop , who was white , for his name and identification .
the cop , joined by several colleagues , arrested the professor for disorderly conduct .
we now know that the professor had broken into his own home , with the help of his chauffeur , because the door was jammed .
what was unusual here was not the cop ’ s heavy-handedness .
most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police , they will get nasty very fast .
the fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done .
that , too , would not have been unusual .
what made this case special was that Henry Louis “ Skip ” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country , famous for his books , his articles , and numerous television appearances .
he is a grandee , a mover and shaker in the academic and media world , a friend of President Barack Obama .
that is why he warned the cop , Sgt. James Crowley , a veteran of the Cambridge police force , not to mess with him .
class and race overlap in the US .
in this instance , it is impossible to pry them apart .
Gates , deeply conscious , indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country , instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice .
from his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity .
as he put it to his daughter in an interview published online : “ &#91; Crowley &#93; should have gotten out of there and said , ‘ I ’ m sorry , sir , good luck .
loved your &#91; television &#93; series — check with you later ! ’ ”
Alas , Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates .
a local man whose brothers all serve in the police force , a sports fan , and an amateur basketball coach , Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates .
as it happens , the charges were duly dropped , and there the case might have rested if President Obama , tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill , had not weighed in on behalf of his “ friend ” Gates , and called the police “ stupid . ”
both he and Gates then spoke of “ learning ” from the incident .
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling .
one thing to be learned , if we didn ’ t know this already , is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life , despite the election of a black president .
the complexities of black anger , white guilt , and of black , and white fear , are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all .
the field is too full of mines .
one of Obama ’ s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric .
and there remains plenty to talk about : the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons ; the lack of educational opportunities in poor , mostly black areas ; the appalling healthcare system ; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks , who don ’ t have the privilege of a Harvard ID .
it is probably true that many white policemen , even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling , as Sgt. Crowley was , need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge , or any other American city .
but is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion ?
one might argue that itwas .
if not Professor Gates , then who ?
precisely because he is a grandee , he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue .
if the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem , or some other poor , or predominantly black district , no one would ever have heard about it .
the fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice .
there is , however , a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race .
by having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse .
indeed , we don ’ t even know for certain whether this was such an instance .
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates ’ skin .
there was no question of violence .
there were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect , on the part of the professor , and of the cop .
outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless , poor , anonymous people , whom most of us find it too easy to ignore .
Berlin – Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl , the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions : nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap .
indeed , the opposite is true .
nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks : plant safety , nuclear waste , and , most menacing of all , the risk of military proliferation .
Moreover , the alternatives to nuclear energy – and to fossil fuels – are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable .
taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity ; it is a deliberate political choice .
fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that , at the time , only a minority of people worldwide , largely in the West , benefited from technological progress .
by contrast , the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources , which are indispensable for human survival , are finite , and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have .
meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity .
the energy future of nine billion people , which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century , lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy , but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency .
we already know this .
why , then , do the most advanced countries , in particular , take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission ?
the answer , ultimately , doesn ’ t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy , but first and foremost with its military applications .
the energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon , the atomic bomb .
being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige .
even today , the Bomb divides the world into two classes : the few states have it , and the many that do not .
the old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers , the United States and Soviet Union .
to stop others from trying to become nuclear powers , which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation , the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) was framed in the 1960 ’ s .
to this day , it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world , imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves .
of course , the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it .
to this day , therefore , the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase , particularly given small and medium powers ’ hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts .
Iran is the most current example of this .
the nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous , and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists .
despite the NPT , a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn ’ t always worked , or worked completely , because the NPT ’ s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use – under international supervision – all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes .
from here , then , all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders ’ decision to take them .
this political power , not the requirements of energy policy , is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult .
as a rule , the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called “ civilian ” nuclear programs .
the supposed “ civilian ” nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus , for instance , led to a large number of such “ civilian ” programs in neighboring states .
Honni soit qui mal y pense !
and , of course , the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called “ clandestine threshold countries . ”
so how will the world – first and foremost , the main nuclear powers – react to the Fukushima disaster ?
will the tide truly turn , propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons ?
or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible ?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching , fundamental choice .
it was Japan , the high-tech country par excellence ( not the latter-day Soviet Union ) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks .
what , then , will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities ?
any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons : despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents , the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course .
were they to abandon nuclear energy , however , their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation .
WAGENINGEN , NETHERLANDS – Born in 1957 , the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) is now more than 50 years old , and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child .
but superficial repairs will not meet the European Union ’ s future needs .
the CAP must be born again .
work on its renewal is due to start now , with the completed project ready in 2013 .
but a much more profound re-think is needed .
the CAP ’ s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union , which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency .
good , healthy , and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens .
improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union ’ s growing wealth .
instruments to achieve those objectives were developed , and food security was achieved .
the CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project .
as the EU has evolved and expanded , food systems have become more complex , involving production , processing , supply-chain organization , and wholesale and retail distribution , with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment .
the use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny .
a 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy , entitledGround for Choices , demonstrated that the EU ’ s food supply could be met with 50 % less cultivated land , 80 % less pesticides , and at 50 % less cost .
pollution would be reduced by 70 % as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water , and greenhouse gases would be cut .
those figures were for an EU of 15 countries , so with today ’ s 27 members the possibilities are even greater .
a Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land , substantial gains could be made in food production .
so it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially .
viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas , there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP ’ s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced .
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered .
Thestatus quo clearly has to be changed .
rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community .
but that attitude is undermining change .
competition must be encouraged , as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community , with fewer farmers but better farms .
a simplified CAP would encourage cleaner , more productive , and efficient agriculture .
a side benefit for the EU ’ s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization ’ s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe .
Moreover , the CAP ’ s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place .
but renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces , as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society .
if the market “ misbehaves , ” farmers could be reduced to poverty , leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe .
that is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars .
1 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture ’ s competitiveness .
such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands , substantially contributing to the development and power of the country ’ s agribusiness .
ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness , including horticultural seeds , ornamentals , seed potatoes , and veal , are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country ’ s trade balance .
in the EU as a whole , a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture ’ s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development .
2 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use .
many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level , but agricultural production and land use are not among them .
the development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure .
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy .
3 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; A policy for European food systems would treat production , processing , distribution , logistics , and retailing in combination .
consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems .
preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation ’ s “ Forward Look on European Food Systems ” could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy .
4 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land .
it offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects .
5 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe ’ s landscapes .
but a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere , nor should it ignore cost .
and it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land .
these five pillars involve drastic choices , but they will probably require less money from Europe ’ s taxpayers , not more .
they could make a real contribution to cleaner , more productive , and efficient farming and land use , while addressing social needs .
new YORK – Today ’ s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures .
nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago .
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action .
with Spain ’ s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon ’ s partnership , several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world ’ s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap .
the benefits of some donor help can be remarkable .
peasant farmers in Africa , Haiti , and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers .
the result is a grain yield ( for example , maize ) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs .
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare , compared with more than four tons per hectare in China , where farmers use fertilizers heavily .
African farmers know that they need fertilizer ; they just can ’ t afford it .
with donor help , they can .
not only do these farmers then feed their families , but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future .
by building up savings over a few years , the farmers eventually become creditworthy , or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own .
there is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers ( those with two hectares or less of land , or impoverished pastoralists ) , which is especially urgent in Africa .
the UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $ 8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds , fertilizer , irrigation systems , and extension training .
in addition to direct help for small farms , donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties , especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding , excess nitrogen , salty soils , crop pests , and other challenges to sustainable food production .
helping the poor with today ’ s technologies , while investing in future improved technologies , is the optimum division of labor .
this investment pays off wonderfully , with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution .
these centers are not household names , but they deserve to be .
their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world , and we ’ ll need more of them .
dozens of low-income , food-deficit countries , perhaps as many as 40-50 , have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms , but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding .
these countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing , and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program ( GFCRP ) .
but the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries ’ urgent needs , and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used .
hundreds of millions of people , in the meantime , remain trapped in hunger .
many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture , but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so .
the current aid structures are inadequate .
the more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively .
despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals , the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate .
the 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers .
African countries search endlessly , and mostly fruitlessly , for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds .
my colleagues and I , serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative , have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account , which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism ( FCM ) .
these pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer , improved seed varieties , and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need .
poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account , rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors .
by pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM , aid programs ’ administrative costs could be kept low , the availability of aid flows could be assured , and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help .
the time for business as usual is over .
the donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010 , but are still far off track .
indeed , during the past 20 years , they actually cut aid for agriculture programs , and only now are reversing course .
meanwhile , a billion people go hungry each day .
we need a breakthrough that is demonstrable , public , clear , and convincing , that can mobilize the public ’ s hearts and minds , and that can demonstrate success .
history can be made in Madrid at the end of January , when the world ’ s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis .
the lives of the billion poorest people depend on it .
Cambridge – With youth unemployment touching 50 % in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece , is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable ?
if so , does enlarging the euro ’ s membership really serve Europe ’ s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union ?
the good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency .
the bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that , at least for large countries , currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders .
at a minimum , currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone .
what of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell ’ s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap ?
in his provocative American Economic Review paper “ A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas , ” Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were , the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment .
he credited another ( future ) Nobel Prize winner , James Meade , for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work , but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently , especially in the context of Europe ’ s nascent integration .
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises , but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever .
not surprisingly , workers are leaving the eurozone ’ s crisis countries , but not necessarily for its stronger northern region .
instead , Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau .
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada , Australia , and the United States .
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania , which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain .
still , if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell ’ s ideal , today we would not be seeing 25 % unemployment in Spain while Germany ’ s unemployment rate is below 7 % .
later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union , which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration .
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960 ’ s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber , a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk .
for a normal country , the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions .
in the US , when oil prices go up , incomes in Texas and Montana rise , which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget , thereby helping out the rest of the country .
Europe , of course , has no significant centralized tax authority , so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent .
some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers , because any desired degree of risk sharing can , in theory , be achieved through financial markets .
this claim was hugely misguided .
financial markets can be fragile , and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income , which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy .
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness .
but , in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels , the short term can stretch out for a very long time .
many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube , much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century .
indeed , more than 20 years on , Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification .
later , Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that , in addition to fiscal transfers , a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort .
otherwise , bank runs and debt panics will be rampant .
Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks , but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities .
a logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld , and even of Mundell ’ s labor-mobility criterion , is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy , most likely involving region-wide popular elections .
Europe ’ s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework .
European policymakers today often complain that , were it not for the US financial crisis , the eurozone would be doing just fine .
perhaps they are right .
but any financial system must be able to withstand shocks , including big ones .
Europe may never be an “ optimum ” currency area by any standard .
but , without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade .
Oxford – In Anthony Burgess ’ s novella ( and Stanley Kubrick ’ s film ) A Clockwork Orange , Alex , an unrepentant psychopath , has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images .
like Pavlov ’ s dog , Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex .
this scene remains shocking , but , like most science fiction , it has aged .
the behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired , and the fear that science will be used to make , or even force , people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned .
science fiction ages fast , but it has a long afterlife .
over the past decade , an army of psychologists , neuroscientists , and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural “ clockwork ” that underlies human morality .
they have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy , and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism , and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions .
and to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it .
indeed , scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions , but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity .
a recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios .
individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others .
another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray , it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups , but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders .
neuroscientists have even magnetically “ zapped ” carefully targeted areas of people ’ s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways – for example , making it easier for them to lie .
of course , no one is developing a “ moral pill ” that will transform us into saints .
but the research is advancing fast , and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions , sentiments , and motivations .
should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better ?
a Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence , and some of its scenes are still hard to watch .
but as Burgess himself argued , the novella has an almost Christian message : what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil , and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as , and perhaps even worse than , the sadism of psychopaths like Alex .
I suspect that many will agree with this view .
they will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard , not a broken clock that scientists should fix .
of course , most of us don ’ t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture .
but this does not mean that we are morally good , or good enough .
as you read this , perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others .
even in the most advanced and affluent societies , a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency : think of locks , security alarms , police , courts , and prisons .
and it is doubtful that we really care enough about others , or give enough to the less fortunate .
humans are born with the capacity to be moral , but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world .
for thousands of years , humans have relied on education , persuasion , social institutions , and the threat of real ( or supernatural ) punishment to make people behave decently .
we could all be morally better , but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further .
it is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics , or better arguments .
so we shouldn ’ t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help – in the first instance , by helping us design more effective institutions , more inspiring moral education , or more persuasive ethical arguments .
but science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains .
science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible .
it would be self-defeating , or worse , to try to promote morality through brutal coercion .
governments must not be given the power to control its citizens ’ moral code – we know that if they had such power , they would misuse it .
it would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves , whether by practicing mindfulness , reading moral philosophy , or , yes , by taking a ’ morality ’ pill .
but it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster , it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better .
it is not clear that people really want to be morally better .
and those who , like the psychopathic Alex , need the most help are probably those who would want it least .
these are , of course , hypothetical questions .
we don ’ t yet know what is possible .
but it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late .
and even if “ moral pills ” are just science fiction , they raise deep questions .
will we want to take them if they ever become available ?
and what does it say about us if we won ’ t ?
PRINCETON – When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland ’ s Eyjafjallajökull volcano , it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped , but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed .
was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban , or was it a reflection of the hardship , both personal and economic , that the ban was causing ?
over six days , about 95,000 flights were canceled , at a cost to airlines of more than $ 1 billion .
an estimated five million people were stranded or delayed .
the British economy lost £ 1.5 billion , and others were similarly affected .
Flower growers in Kenya , who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe , suddenly had no income .
sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada .
in the past , jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power , and in one case , dropped thousands of feet , although all managed to land safely .
but there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems .
the decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft , and that no matter how slight that risk might be , the government ’ s job was , as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it , “ to make sure that safety was paramount . ”
indeed , in closing their skies , European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else .
yet none of them act on that principle in other areas .
some 3,000 people die on the world ’ s roads every day .
cutting speed limits to , say , 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives .
we don ’ t do it , because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving .
the price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite .
it is distasteful to put a price on human life , but the more we spend on safety , the less we will have for our other goals .
the British government uses a figure of a little more than £ 1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life – for example , by improving road safety .
in the US , the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $ 5.8 million – nearly four times as much , at current exchange rates – for the same purpose .
does that mean that safety is paramount in the US , but not in Britain ?
Giovanni Bisignani , the head of the International Air Transport Association , an industry group , criticized the shutdown , saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken .
on the whole , though , the public seemed to support the decision .
stranded travelers , interviewed at airports , typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky .
but what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk , or just a more urgent need to travel , than others ?
John Stuart Mill , in his classic book On Liberty , considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe .
in Mill ’ s view , we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger .
once he knows of it , the decision is his to make , because only he can judge the importance of his journey , and balance that against the risk he is running .
air safety is slightly different , because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground , but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew .
if they are fully informed of the risks , and are still willing to fly – perhaps the crew has been offered more money , as workers in dangerous occupations often are – should we prevent them from making the decision to fly ?
in the end , after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage , and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere , Europe ’ s skies were reopened .
the International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly .
now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety , we know that this is not only a technical question .
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question : how safe should we aim to be ?
PRINCETON – Russian President Vladimir Putin ’ s anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia ’ s leaders have not changed a whit .
it looks increasingly likely that , as under Leonid Brezhnev , we will see the same names in the news for decades to come .
according to Gleb Pavlovsky , the Putin regime ’ s leading ideologist , the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one : it doesn ’ t know its enemies .
indeed , it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt , the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics .
in the spirit of Schmitt , Putin ’ s men designated a liberal party , the Union of Right Forces , as their ur-enemy .
its public meetings were broken up by armed police ; its leaders arrested and beaten ; Putin called its supporters “ coyotes . ”
what is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger .
oil prices are soaring , as are Putin ’ s approval ratings .
his appointees control everything that matters , from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee .
since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies , the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents , and the massive “ social investments ” of recent years , which , under Medvedev ’ s personal supervision , have bribed the population , no credible force can seriously challenge Putin ’ s men .
yet their regime is in crisis , and they know it .
Russia ’ s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before .
military reform has been reversed .
despite increasing incomes , Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power ; they still die at a shockingly young age .
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption .
state monopolies undo what private businesses created .
with more money , ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats ; as a result , the regime fails to rule the country .
the country is unruly , and its rulers know it .
so they panic .
Putin ’ s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia ’ s security forces .
his generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it “ directed and controlled , ” including the KGB .
under Putin , the security service has had its revenge .
its people have become powerful , arrogant , and enormously rich .
they have also become disobedient .
in 2004 , General Viktor Cherkesov , then Putin ’ s representative in northwest Russia , published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country .
this essay , more than anything else , defined Putin ’ s second term .
in October 2007 , Cherkesov ( now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services , the Federal Anti-Drug Administration ) published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues ’ degradation : warriors had turned into traders , he complained .
earlier , generals from a competing service , the FSB , had arrested Cherkesov ’ s deputy for “ illegal bugging . ”
in a public gesture of despair , Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin ’ s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services .
Cherkesov ’ s deputy remains in prison . most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense .
in the absence of Communist Party control , these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading , applying force when a trade did not go well .
that this happens to ordinary Russians is clear ; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin ’ s circle also confronts this situation .
what is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another ?
Cherkesov ’ s case exemplifies Putin ’ s nightmare .
but if your instincts betray you , you go back to even deeper ones .
now that Putin ’ s people have left their predecessors ’ neo-liberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the ex-KGB clique , the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services , the administration , business , and much else .
this party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction .
Preaching nationalism , its managers will believe in their universal competence , as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism .
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree .
Putin ’ s lawyers will reverse that decision ; the party will have cells or committees in every factory , corporation , military unit , university department , etc . integrated by the leader ’ s charisma and party discipline , party members will direct and unify the desolated country .
this is Putin ’ s plan .
like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov , the only other KGB man to rule Russia , Putin will become the party ’ s general secretary .
as in the Soviet era , state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers – the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin .
and , of course , being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit .
in the end , Putin has what history left him : not ideas , just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power .
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality ; Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party .
it is a bizarre ideology .
accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves , it shuns its Marxist origins .
it will subordinate all who really do work – traders , warriors , journalists , and others – to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies .
London – Last month , while in New York City , I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
to accommodate his security needs , the hotel had been converted into a fortress , much like Israel itself .
Netanyahu was in the United States for yet another round of Middle East peace talks .
the US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another 90 days .
the Israelis refused ; another impasse was reached .
what , then , might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land ?
the answer is : very poor .
all peace efforts since the Oslo accords of 1993 have been based on the “ two-state solution , ” according to which Israel is supposed to turn over the occupied territories to a Palestinian state , the Palestinians are supposed to renounce any claims on the Jewish state , and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after .
a negotiated “ land for peace ” solution still remains official Western doctrine .
as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech , “ a just , lasting , and comprehensive peace ” has to be based on “ two states for two peoples . ”
meanwhile , the two main parties to the dispute , Palestine and Israel , are searching for unilateral alternatives to the stymied “ peace process . ”
the Palestinians are pushing for international recognition of their statehood , while the Israelis are using their settlement policy to preempt a Palestinian state .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that , if the latest peace talks collapse , he will press for UN recognition of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders .
this month , Brazil and Argentina recognized “ Palestine , ” and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow .
Abbas is now setting his sights on Europe , and would ask Turkey to serve as a go-between .
the game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to pressure the US to retreat from its almost unconditional support for Israeli policy .
Israel ’ s main concern continues to be security .
the official Western doctrine is that Israel ’ s long-term security depends on the success of the “ peace process . ”
in practice , Israel has been taking other measures to secure its future .
media attention has been focused on the “ security wall , ” which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence .
but , to the hawks who now control Israeli politics , the key to Israel ’ s security depends on depth of defense , for which expansion of the settlements is indispensable .
the hawks ’ recipe for survival is threefold : continued military and economic support from the US , defensible frontiers through a strategic settlement program , and the carve-up of the Palestinian West Bank into disconnected bantustans , or subordinate authorities , incapable of concerted opposition to Israeli policy .
thus , while Abbas seeks to create a new “ fact on the ground ” by drumming up international support for a Palestinian state , Israel aims to trump him by making such a state unviable .
the ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states , but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state .
indeed , the two-state solution was always an illusion .
there was never enough land to satisfy the passionate possessiveness of all those with claims to it .
and , over time , Israeli settler disengagement from the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become just as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel its remaining Arabs .
Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper .
these are the “ facts on the ground ” that doom Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state no less than Israeli hopes for a wholly Jewish state .
Moreover , land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view .
if compensation for wrongs to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle , there were always better ways of going about it than to found a rickety , poverty-ridden new country dependent on foreign aid .
most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the occupied territories , with a joint Economic Council to adjudicate trade disputes .
the free movement of goods , labor , and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to Palestinian GDP .
it could also have been the basis of a confederal state , whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers ’ productivity and taxes .
but this benign prospect was undermined by the violence needed to maintain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one .
the official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-state settlement will bring about the security needed for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories .
but it is just possible that unilateral Israeli policy , implicitly backed by the US , will create interim conditions of peace that are sufficient for economic growth to cool Palestinian nationalism .
the Palestinian cause is not the overriding preoccupation of even the Arab states , so Netanyahu ’ s strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than Abbas ’ s pursuit of statehood through international recognition .
Netanyahu ’ s project is not moral .
but that doesn ’ t mean that it won ’ t work , at least for a time .
time is running out in Kosovo . if a United Nations-backed settlement is not reached by early December , the province ’ s majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally – a move that the United States has announced it may support .
that would be a disastrous step .
Russia would be furious , because it fears that Kosovo ’ s secession – whether or not it is internationally recognized – might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire .
Serbia is even more strongly opposed .
Dusan Prorokovic , Serbia ’ s state secretary for Kosovo , has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty .
even if the government hesitates , ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops : the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin ( only 40 “ military observers ” and 2,116 policemen ) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous .
after eight years of international administration , Kosovo ’ s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence .
but Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition .
Moreover , independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public , which has already watched in dismay as “ Great Serbia ” has been gradually whittled away , most recently with the secession of Montenegro .
Serbia is prepared to concede only “ enhanced autonomy ” to Kosovo , and some capacity to enter into international agreements .
yet , while the two parties now seem irreconcilable , it is not too late for compromise .
but this is possible only by resuscitating – and updating – an old institution of the international community : a confederation of states .
by means of a binding UN Security Council resolution , Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory , as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene .
it could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals ( for example , admission and circulation of foreigners , or extradition ) , plus the right to seek admission to the UN ( which does not require full sovereignty and independence ) .
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood .
however , a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo , Serbia , and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues ( for example , alliances and relations with international economic institutions ) , defence , borders ( in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania ) , and the treatment of Kosovo ’ s Serbian minority .
as a result , Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects , bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body .
of course , this confederation would be asymmetrical , because the Serbian government ’ s sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited , whereas the Kosovar government ’ s “ sovereignty ” over Kosovo would be restrained .
to avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions , the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates , two Kosovar delegates , and three representatives of the EU , thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates .
in addition , the EU should create a small but effective military force ( say , 5,000 troops ) to back up the common body ’ s decisions .
as with any compromise , the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement .
Serbia would save face , and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo , including the treatment of the Serbian minority .
Kosovo would acquire limited independence , with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN .
the EU would benefit as well , by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area .
subsequently , the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent .
a final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary .
historically , confederations sooner or later either become federations ( as occurred in the US , Germany , and Switzerland ) or , pushed by centrifugal forces , split up ( as with the United Arab Republic , established in 1958 , which split three years later into Egypt and Syria ) .
the confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage ( lasting five or ten years ) , at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent .
delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo ’ s prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing “ sovereign authority ” with other independent states , which could deflate Kosovars ’ dangerously robust nationalistic demands .
new YORK – Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory ?
plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation , documentation , and inference that takes shape – usually on the Internet – and spreads virally around the globe .
in the process , conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse , where they were generally consigned in the past , and sometimes into the very heart of politics .
I learned this by accident .
having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years , I found myself , in researching new developments , stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation .
there are some major themes .
a frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting – via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations , among others – to establish a “ One World Government ” dominated by themselves rather than national governments .
sometimes , more folkloric details come into play , broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati , the Freemasons , Rhodes Scholars , or , as always , the Jews .
the hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis .
in literary terms , this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims .
historically , there tends to be the same set of themes : fearsome , uncontrolled transformative change led by educated , urbanized cosmopolitans .
students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks – rapid urbanization , disruption of traditional family and social ties , loosening of sexual restrictions , and economic collapse – primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering .
similarly , the “ 9 / 11 Truth Movement ” asserts that al-Qaeda ’ s attack on the Twin Towers was an “ inside job . ”
in the Muslim world , there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks , and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day .
usually , conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking .
so why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays ?
today ’ s explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past : rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty .
a clearly designated “ enemy ” with an unmistakable “ plan ” is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings – or failures – of unfettered capitalism .
and , while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational , the questions they address are often healthy , even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong .
in seeking answers , these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities .
many citizens believe , rightly , that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses .
newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding , and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut .
concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust , setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum .
likewise , in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping – if not drafting – public policies , many people believe , again rightly , that their elected officials no longer represent them .
hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces .
finally , even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because , in the last eight years , we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies .
the Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war , using fabricated evidence to do so .
is it any wonder , then , that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque ?
when even the 9 / 11 commissioners renounce their own conclusions ( because they were based on evidence derived from torture ) , is it surprising that many want a second investigation ?
frequently enough , it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse – pursuing such theories – who report on news that the mainstream media ignores .
for example , it took a “ conspiracy theorist , ” Alex Jones , to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens . the New Yorker confirmed the story much later – without crediting the original source .
the mainstream media ’ s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias .
conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow .
so even good , critical questions or well-sourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists .
the real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview , and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions .
this is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia .
in a fevered environment , without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing , citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues , as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin ’ s rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists .
we need to change the flow of information in the Internet age .
citizens should be able more easily to leak information , pitch stories , and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters .
they should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting , unmediated by corporate pressures .
and citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism : finding good data , confirming stories with two independent sources , using quotes responsibly , and eschewing anonymity – that is , standing by their own bylines , as conventional reporters do .
this is how citizens can be taken – and take themselves – seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation .
in a time of official lies , healthy investigative energy should shed light , not just generate heat .
changing constitutions is always a risky business .
but it is a downright dangerous one when undertaken to benefit one man alone .
indeed , when a president volunteers to reduce the powers of his own office , you can be certain that he is up to no good .
that is exactly what is going on in Ukraine , where President Leonid Kuchma proposes to junk our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has concocted .
Kuchma has not suddenly converted to the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones .
no , Kuchma wants to change Ukraine &apos;s constitution for no other reason than to maintain his grip on power .
today , Kuchma rules as an all-powerful president .
but his term ends next year and he cannot run again .
so , instead of retiring gracefully , as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin routinely do , Kuchma wants to change the constitution in order to become an all-powerful prime minister who will never face a limit on the length of his term .
of course , constitutions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is rotten .
constitutions can , and should , accommodate reform when necessary .
a powerful president , however , is not necessarily wrong for Ukraine .
in our wrenching postcommunist transition , it is essential that a government can act decisively .
to change a system that seems best suited to Ukraine &apos;s circumstances , you need a good reason .
the Ukraine president is authorized to appoint and sack the prime minister , dissolve parliament if he wishes , and rule by decree if he judges that the country &apos;s institutions are in danger .
he maintains day-to-day control over every aspect of government .
Sopuissant a Caesar must be above reproach .
Kuchma is not .
on the contrary , what is rotten in Ukraine is not its constitution , but its president , who is mired in charges of corruption and orchestrating the murder of journalists , and who is shunned by other world leaders .
as president , Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular .
even Slobodan Milosevic had more support in Yugoslavia before his fall .
so Kuchma knows that he cannot rely on handpicking his successor , as Yeltsin did in Russia .
unable to assure himself of a tame presidential successor , Kuchma wants what he calls a &quot; parliamentary republic &quot; with a weak president and powerful prime minister .
but the parliament he has in mind is a mutant , one where the authoritarian rule of the criminal clans Kuchma controls will continue , unabated , behind the facade of parliamentary procedure .
people too easily forget Ukraine , this big country on the border of the soon-to-be enlarged European Union .
but any attempt to prolong Kuchma &apos;s rule will create such a political mess that it is not absurd to fear that Ukraine could follow Belarus and the Balkans of the early 1990 &apos;s into outright dictatorship and chaos .
indeed , this scenario could worsen , because Russia is unlikely to sit around idly and watch Ukraine unravel .
intervention of some type seems more likely in such circumstances .
only an imperial Russia , however , would dare reabsorb Ukraine .
but an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia .
so Kuchma endangers freedom and human rights not only in Ukraine , but ultimately threatens Russia &apos;s democracy as well .
Luckily , there has never been a better time for the West--particularly the EU--to nudge Ukraine back from the brink .
with EU expansion coming next spring , all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Union &apos;s easternmost border in Poland .
although the job of maintaining Ukraine &apos;s democracy is primarily one for Ukrainians , the EU can help if it takes practical steps to reassure Ukrainians that they won &apos;t be cut off from the rest of Europe .
a generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in Ukraine that will benefit impoverished eastern Poland , are two possible inducements .
but these should be made conditional on Kuchma leaving the country &apos;s constitution and democracy alone .
the EU should not fret about interfering in Ukraine &apos;s domestic affairs .
after all , it hesitated little a few years ago to put a current member state , Austria , on notice that it was watching out for the welfare of that country &apos;s democracy .
the wayward Kuchma is far more deserving of Europe imposing safeguards to ensure his good behavior .
similarly , the US should cast a wary eye at Kuchma &apos;s decision to send troops to Iraq .
it cannot be the case that America &apos;s fidelity to democracy in Ukraine can be so cynically purchased .
within Ukraine , a government capable of truly governing should seek to adopt EU laws and norms in exactly the manner that the countries poised to join the Union have done , thus helping to clean up the murky system in which Kuchma &apos;s criminal cronies flourish .
the constitution must be reformed , but not to shift power from one unaccountable leader to another .
what is needed are clear checks on arbitrary rule , and transparency in decision-making .
no one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power , no matter what .
less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election ( or any other kind of election ) if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued misrule .
it is , after all , President Kuchma who is discredited , not Ukraine &apos;s constitutional arrangements .
new YORK – The Great Recession of 2008 has morphed into the North Atlantic Recession : it is mainly Europe and the United States , not the major emerging markets , that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment .
and it is Europe and America that are marching , alone and together , to the denouement of a grand debacle .
a busted bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that averted a much deeper recession , but that also fueled substantial budget deficits .
the response – massive spending cuts – ensures that unacceptably high levels of unemployment ( a vast waste of resources and an oversupply of suffering ) will continue , possibly for years .
the European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members .
it had no choice : with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain , the euro ’ s very survival was in growing jeopardy .
Europe ’ s leaders recognized that distressed countries ’ debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow , and that growth could not be achieved without assistance .
but , even as Europe ’ s leaders promised that help was on the way , they doubled down on the belief that non-crisis countries must cut spending .
the resulting austerity will hinder Europe ’ s growth , and thus that of its most distressed economies : after all , nothing would help Greece more than robust growth in its trading partners .
and low growth will hurt tax revenues , undermining the proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation .
the discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals .
the European Central Bank ’ s vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies – the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities ’ debt – is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system .
the ECB argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for Greece ’ s bad sovereign debt , for fear that any private-sector involvement ( PSI ) would trigger a “ credit event , ” which would force large payouts on credit-default swaps ( CDSs ) , possibly fueling further financial turmoil .
but , if that is a real fear for the ECB – if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders – surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital .
likewise , the ECB should have barred banks from the risky CDS market , where they are held hostage to ratings agencies ’ decisions about what constitutes a “ credit event . ”
indeed , one positive achievement by European leaders at the recent Brussels summit was to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of the American ratings agencies .
indeed , the most curious aspect of the ECB ’ s position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event .
the whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remainder more manageable .
if the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring , surely they were safer after the restructuring , and thus equally acceptable .
this episode serves as a reminder that central banks are political institutions , with a political agenda , and that independent central banks tend to be captured ( at least “ cognitively ” ) by the banks that they are supposed to regulate .
and matters are little better on the other side of the Atlantic .
there , the extreme right threatened to shut down the US government , confirming what game theory suggests : when those who are irrationally committed to destruction if they don ’ t get their way confront rational individuals , the former prevail .
as a result , President Barack Obama acquiesced in an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy , with no tax increases – not even for the millionaires who have done so well during the past two decades , and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies , which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation .
Optimists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America ’ s debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited – roughly $ 25 billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year .
but the payroll-tax cut ( which put more than $ 100 billion into the pockets of ordinary Americans ) was not renewed , and surely business , anticipating the contractionary effects down the line , will be even more reluctant to lend .
the end of the stimulus itself is contractionary .
and , with housing prices continuing to fall , GDP growth faltering , and unemployment remaining stubbornly high ( one of six Americans who would like a full-time job still cannot get one ) , more stimulus , not austerity , is needed – for the sake of balancing the budget as well .
the single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues , owing to poor economic performance ; the single best remedy would be to put America back to work .
the recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction .
there has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America .
after all , America ’ s financial mismanagement played an important role in triggering Europe ’ s problems , and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US – especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-transparent CDSs .
but the real problem stems from another form of contagion : bad ideas move easily across borders , and misguided economic notions on both sides of the Atlantic have been reinforcing each other .
the same will be true of the stagnation that those policies bring .
the British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming , and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions , in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences .
written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics , who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank , the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming , but whether we can afford not to .
the report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1 % of annual consumption , but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater .
the reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear , with a non-negligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought .
indeed , the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs : for instance , climate change may lead to more weather variability , a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream – of particular concern to Europe – and a flourishing of disease .
when I served in 1995 on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming , there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution , that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases , and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels .
but few saw , for instance , the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case .
still , some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be , we should do little or nothing .
to me , uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today , not less .
as one scientist friend puts it : if you are driving on a mountain road , approaching a cliff , in a car whose brakes may fail , and a fog bank rolls in , should you drive more or less cautiously ?
global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large .
scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend .
as the Stern report points out , as usual , the poor are the most vulnerable .
a third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century .
the Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear : our twenty-first-century Atlantis .
to an economist , the problem is obvious : polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause .
pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions .
the advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm , but no war could be more devastating .
a global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate .
this does not mean an increase in overall taxation , but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution ( carbon ) tax for some current taxes .
it makes much more sense to tax things that are bad , like pollution , than things that are good , like savings and work .
although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets , in this case he has called for voluntary action .
but it makes far more sense to use the force of markets – the power of incentives – than to rely on goodwill , especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maximizing profits , regardless of the cost to others .
Exxon has reportedly been funding so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming , just as the tobacco industry funded “ research ” to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer .
some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap , because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean .
the good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages .
the US subsidizes corn-based ethanol , and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol ; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries .
most importantly , price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation .
small changes in practices , when replicated by hundreds of millions of people , can make an enormous difference .
for example , simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning .
we have but one planet , and should treasure it .
global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore .
London – Reading Barack Obama ’ sDreams from My Father , the US president ’ s beautifully written reflections on his early life and identity , most people are struck by his cool and intellectual approach .
this is not to say that he is unemotional .
Obama can rage and weep .
but he rarely seems to act on the basis of raw sentiment or instinctive prejudice .
pragmatic and highly intelligent , sooner or later every issue receives the full attention of his forensic curiosity .
Recalling Hillary Clinton ’ s famous Democratic primary television advertisement , Obama , it turns out , is exactly the sort of president that most of us would want to have in the post for that 3 a.m. phone call about an international crisis .
he would not be afraid to act , but he would be prepared to think first .
I do not think , therefore , that Obama will be too vexed by some of the criticism he faces at the end of his first year in office , though he will undoubtedly grimace at the defeat of the Democratic candidate in the special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy ’ s old seat .
Obama was praised extravagantly a year ago ; 12 months on , the criticism is over the top , too .
Obama inherited a terrible legacy – recession , financial meltdown , Iraq , Afghanistan .
he has not solved all of these problems .
but it is difficult to see any really bad mistakes , except perhaps allowing himself to be pushed around by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and giving China the impression that he was prepared for a bilateral relationship entirely on China ’ s terms .
that seems to be changing now .
Obama may have come to understand that when you are the leader of the world ’ s only superpower , you need to be feared just a little if you are to be respected .
the left in America criticizes Obama for not turning the economy around already .
the right angrily denounces him as a crypto-communist because he wants every American to have health care .
with a dispassionate eye on the long game , what will the president himself be thinking ?
one issue that Obama is certain to have in his sights is a problem that shadowed the world for years .
when I was growing up in the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s , world peace was based on the nuclear standoff between the US and the Soviet Union .
the main strategic assessment on both sides of the Berlin Wall was that if either side made a wrong move , all of us might end up consumed in the flames of a nuclear holocaust .
this was called , in the geostrategic jargon of the day , “ mutually assured destruction , ” or MAD .
the acronym was entirely appropriate .
we have forgotten those days .
yet there are still 23,000 nuclear warheads on our planet , with the explosive power of 150,000 Hiroshima bombs .
terrorist groups would undoubtedly like to get their hands on one .
in all , there are eight nuclear-weapon states – the US , Russia , Britain , France , China , Israel , India , and Pakistan .
North Korea may also have a few bombs .
Iran is believed by many to be trying to develop one .
other states , which have their own civil nuclear capacity , have the potential to develop a weapon .
the number of countries in this category is bound to increase as the number of nuclear power reactors doubles over the next 20 years .
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) has contained the number of nuclear states .
a conference is to be held in May to renew and review it .
Obama clearly recognizes that the NPT needs to be strengthened in order to prevent countries from turning their civil nuclear-power capacity into weapons .
but Obama also knows that if the existing nuclear states want others to accept tougher restrictions , they will have to cut back their nuclear arsenals .
this is principally an issue for the US and Russia , which possess 95 % of the world ’ s nuclear weapons .
in addition , it would help if the US could take a strong lead by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty .
the nuclear issue is one of the biggest items on the Obama agenda .
how it is handled will help to define his presidency .
even before the talking gets serious in May , there will be the question of Iran to sort out .
Iran says that it seeks no more than its own ability to produce nuclear power .
disbelief grows with every revelation of secret Iranian facilities and plans , and with every refusal by Iran to negotiate safeguards that would allow for civil use while preventing weaponization .
the US , the European Union , and Russia have tried to engage Iran on this issue , so far without success .
China seems likely to block effective sanctions on Iran because of its close energy relationship with the country .
how China eventually handles this will profoundly affect its standing in the US and Europe .
these are going to be some of the major questions for Obama over the next year and more .
if he gets them right , he can forget about his short-term critics .
Fortunately , he is smart enough to know this .
MUNICH – For a while , it looked as if the European Central Bank ’ s € 1 trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe ’ s banking system had calmed global financial markets .
but now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again , closing in on about 6 % .
of course , this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable .
after all , interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10 % in the decade before the euro was introduced .
even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6 % .
nevertheless , the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden .
the main problem is Spain , where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece , Portugal , Ireland , and Italy combined , and , as in Greece , is in the neighborhood of 100 % of GDP ( 93 % to be precise ) .
a quarter of the labor force and half of Spain ’ s youth are unemployed , reflecting the country ’ s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period .
the current-account deficit remains at 3.5 % of GDP , despite the recession-induced decline in imports , while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again .
Moreover , Spain ’ s debt with the ECB ’ s TARGET settlement system rose by € 55 billion ( $ 72 billion ) between February and March , because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated .
since July 2011 , Spain ’ s TARGET debt has grown by € 199 billion .
capital is in full flight , more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010 .
the cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year ( 2008 ) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press .
the picture is little better in Italy , where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2 % of GDP to a 3 % -of-GDP deficit over the last ten years .
the country ’ s TARGET debt grew by € 76 billion from February to March , with the total since July 2011 reaching € 276 billion .
Italy , too , is being drained of capital ; in fact , the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB ’ s liquidity injection .
it is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy , because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital .
the purpose of the ECB ’ s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market .
in this , too , it has not really been successful , despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table .
indeed , now the French are looking wobbly .
as capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012 , France ’ s TARGET debt increased by € 95 billion .
France , too , has become uncompetitive , owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years .
according to a recent study by Goldman Sachs , the country ’ s price level must drop by an estimated 20 % vis-à-vis the euro average – that is , depreciate in real terms – if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone .
Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15 % , and Spain by roughly 20 % .
while Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30 % and 35 % , respectively , the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone .
these imbalances can be redressed only with great effort , if at all , and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation .
for Greece and Portugal , staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze .
there are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels – bailout funds , eurobonds , or the ECB – from the eurozone ’ s healthy core to the troubled South .
but this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree .
already German , Dutch , and Finish savings amounting to € 15,000 , € 17,000 , and € 21,000 , respectively , per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB .
no one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup .
above all , however , the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity , if not to Europe ’ s economic collapse , because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment .
such systems cannot work , because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system ’ s main steering mechanism .
one cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe ’ s politicians have started down this slippery slope .
London – Public trust in financial institutions , and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them , was an early casualty of the financial crisis .
that is hardly surprising , as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed .
it is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe .
but , unfortunately , if this loss of trust persists , it could be costly for us all .
as Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked , “ Our distrust is very expensive . ” The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago : “ It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence . ”
indeed , much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance .
without mutual trust , economic activity is severely constrained .
even within Europe , there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment , particularly through venture capital investment , and are prepared to use more flexible contracts , which are also beneficial for growth and investment .
so if it is true that trust in financial institutions – and in the governments that oversee them – has been damaged by the crisis , we should care a lot , and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust .
in fact , the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret .
in the United Kingdom , recent survey results are ambiguous .
surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much , and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC .
surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse .
banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets , whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true , and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks , which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government .
the market will prove one side right before too long .
in the United States , there is now a more systematic , independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business .
their financial trust index , based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households , did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009 , following the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
that fall in confidence affected banks , the stock market , and the government and its regulators .
Furthermore , the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior .
in other words , if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply , you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks .
so falling trust had real economic consequences .
Fortunately , the latest survey , published in July this year , shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover , and quite sharply .
this has been positive for the stock market .
there is also a little more confidence in the government ’ s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year .
the latter point , which no doubt reflects the Obama administration ’ s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited , is particularly important , as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government ’ s ability to regulate .
it would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG .
continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could , therefore , have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground .
all these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors .
yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous .
some people are very trusting of others , and of the firms and institutions with which they do business .
others are congenitally distrustful .
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals ’ income .
a pan-European opinion survey , which has been carried out for many years , allows us to relate the two .
it asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal .
the data show , intriguingly , that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes .
is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them ?
it would seem not , as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average .
in other words , if you diverge markedly from society ’ s average level of trust , you are likely to lose out , either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange , or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused .
when anyone I don ’ t know says “ trust me ” – an irritating conversational tic – I usually close my wallet .
perhaps most academics , who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale , do the same .
Maybe we should trust each other more – but not too much .
new HAVEN – Few economists predicted the current economic crisis , and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes .
so , not surprisingly , economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end , either .
of course , we all know the proximate causes of an economic crisis : people are not spending , because their incomes have fallen , their jobs are insecure , or both .
but we can take it a step further back : people ’ s income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago – and so on , backwards in time , in a repeating feedback loop .
it is a vicious circle , but where and why did it start ?
why did it worsen ?
what will reverse it ?
it is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers .
the state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the Great Depression that followed the 1929 stock market crash .
economists did not predict that event , either .
in the 1920 ’ s , some warned about an overpriced stock market , but they did not predict a decade-long depression affecting the entire economy .
late in the Great Depression , in August 1938 , an article by Ralph M. Blagden inThe Christian Science Monitor reported an informal set of interviews with US “ professors , banking experts , union leaders , and representatives of business associations and political factions , ” all of whom were given the same question : “ What causes recessions ? ” The multiplicity of answers seemed bewildering , and did not inspire confidence that anyone knew what was causing the deepest crisis of capitalism .
the causes given were “ distributed widely among government , labor , industry , international politics and policies . ” They included misguided government interference with markets , high income and capital gains taxes , mistaken monetary policy , pressures towards high wages , monopoly , overstocked inventories , uncertainty caused by the reorganization plan for the Supreme Court , rearmament in Europe and fear of war , government encouragement of labor disputes , a savings glut because of population shrinkage , the passing of the frontier , and easy credit before the depression .
although economic theory today is much improved , if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis , we will mostly get the same answers .
we would certainly hear some new ones , too : unprecedented real-estate bubbles , a global savings glut , international trade imbalances , exotic financial contracts , sub-prime mortgages , unregulated over-the-counter markets , rating agencies ’ errors , compromised real-estate appraisals , and complacency about counterparty risk .
more likely than not , many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right , for the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors , the chance co-occurrence of a lot of bad things , which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point .
at that point , the trouble grabbed widespread attention , destroyed public confidence , and set in motion a negative feedback loop .
our attention , after all , is naturally drawn to the worst events . &amp; nbsp ; Precisely because the worst events are statistical outliers , their causes are probably multiple .
consider the question of predicting events like the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti , which killed more than 200,000 people .
it captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage .
but if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predicting the extent of the damage , one could surely devise a long list of contributing factors – including even political , financial , and insurance factors – that resembles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis .
indeed , the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes .
for , in a complicated economic system that feeds back on itself in many ways , events that start a vicious cycle might be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon , which , by flapping its wings , sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a far-away hurricane .
chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions , and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future .
weather forecasters cannot forecast far into the future , either , but at least they have precise mathematical models .
massive parallel computers are programmed to yield numerical solutions of differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics . &amp; nbsp ; Scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather , even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far .
the problem for macroeconomics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to systematize .
the mathematical models that macroeconomists have may resemble weather models in some respects , but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid , immutable theory .
the most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis , Carmen Reinhart ’ s and Kenneth Rogoff ’ sThis Time Is Different , is essentially a summary of lessons learned from virtually every financial crisis in every country in recorded history .
but the book is almost entirely non-theoretical .
it merely documents recurrent patterns .
unfortunately , in 800 years of financial history , there is only one example of a really massive worldwide contraction , namely the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s .
so it is hard to know exactly what to expect in the current contraction based on the Reinhart-Rogoff analysis .
this leaves us trying to use patterns from past , dissimilar crises to try to infer the likely prognosis for the current crisis .
as a result , we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing .
Cambridge – Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates ?
jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people ’ s feelings about fiscal policy , declaring that “ the whole government is a Ponzi scheme . ”
perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $ 50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008 .
personally , I suspect Madoff ’ s unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while .
still , with many of the world ’ s largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt , unprecedented old-age pension obligations , and a downshift in growth , one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is .
in a new paper , “ A Decade of Debt , ” Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States , including federal , state , and local debt , has now surpassed the record 120 % of GDP reached at the end of World War II .
Japan , of course , is in even worse shape , with government debt totaling more than 200 % of GDP .
though this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves , Japan now faces massive disaster-relief costs – and this on top of its depressing demographic trends .
many other rich countries ’ debt levels are also uncomfortably close to 150-year highs , despite relative peace in much of the world .
there is a no easy way out .
for now , low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs , but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods , whereas real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates can rise far more quickly , even for rich countries .
debt crises tend to come out of the blue , hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity .
the single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts .
in principle , an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts .
it is high time to consider novel approaches .
of course , no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems .
and no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises .
many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs – including their pension schemes – more realistic .
the recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start .
a number of countries , including Denmark , the Netherlands , the US , and Belgium , have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies , such as the US Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
but , while these older institutions have proven enormously useful , they are typically quite constrained .
the CBO , for example , is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth , but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future “ fixes ” at face value , somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies .
to enhance credibility , a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence , often with central banks as a role model .
the new vanguard includes councils in Sweden , the United Kingdom , Slovenia , and Canada .
the remit of Sweden ’ s fiscal council is particularly broad , giving it a mandate not only to forecast , but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy .
in principle , an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis .
in the US , such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans , perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk .
it is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks , at least anytime soon .
there is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy .
and fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-dimensional .
still , the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity .
of course , fiscal councils by themselves are not enough , no matter how well designed they are .
it will remain very tempting for each generation to say , “ My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I , so who cares if they have to pay some debt ? ” Moreover , the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias , as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment .
to resist these powerful pressures , fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund , both to protect their independence and to promote accountability .
to be sure , Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right , and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever .
but greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpetual conundrum of outsized deficits .
it is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape .
the fall of Milosevic does not cure the political woes of the Balkans ; indeed , it raises their urgency .
Yugoslavia has disintegrated , but the disintegration is incomplete .
it was in Yugoslavia that Vojislav Kostunica was elected president , but his mandate comes solely from support in Serbia .
Montenegro , Serbia ’ s junior partner in the Yugoslav federation , mostly boycotted the election while Albanians in Kosovo ignored them .
yet it was Yugoslavia , whose foundations are unstable , that was recently admitted to the UN .
a host of problems remain unresolved : relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the status of Kosovo ( not to mention Serbia ’ s northern province of Vojvodina ) .
any resolution – any suggestion of change – will engender new conflicts because of conflicting claims of sovereignty .
however tempting it may be to solve the puzzle by drawing new borders or establishing new entities , this conundrum cannot be resolved in terms of sovereignty .
that traditional solution would only perpetuate the problems of the Balkans .
a new approach is needed : the European Union should use the prospect of European integration as the way to promote regional integration .
the EU could act as a magnet to bring the region closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to Europe .
this idea has great appeal to people in the region , but only the EU can make it happen .
after NATO intervention in Kosovo , European leaders made this approach the cornerstone of their vision for the Balkans . it was enshrined in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit of July , 1999 .
but the Stability Pact is merely a shell – it needs to be filled with content .
the time to do so is at the Zagreb Conference on November 24 called by France as the current EU president .
the European Union should now propose a three-point plan for the Balkans :
$ a customs union with preferential access to EU markets within one year .
the existing EU-Turkey customs union should be used as a model .
once all these countries reach agreement with the EU there would automatically be free trade throughout the Balkans .
this will take some time to implement .
but from the start , the EU should give a signal by unilaterally opening its border to imports from the region .
this cannot endanger any EU interests as the countries at issue now have far less than 1 % of the EU market .
$ a regional VAT to replace the lost customs revenues should be established within two years .
differences in indirect taxes such as VAT pose another way in which borders become obstacles to trade .
they should be unified throughout the region .
regional VAT rates might be increased slightly if expenditure restraint is not sufficient to offset the loss of tariff revenues due to the customs union .
$ Temporary budgetary support on a declining scale for three years , subject to EU supervision over budgetary expenditures .
because it will take time to collect revenues from the regional VAT , the EU should provide financial help during the transition .
the area covered by this plan would include Bulgaria , Croatia and Albania as well as Serbia , Bosnia , Macedonia , Montenegro and Kosovo .
participation by Romania and Moldova is optional .
Bulgaria and Croatia could be persuaded to participate provided it would not interfere with their candidacy for EU membership .
depending on the country , there could be more or less budgetary support .
( Bulgaria , for example , might not need compensation since to a great extent it has already eliminated tariffs ) .
in comparison to the cost of military intervention and peacekeeping , the financial costs here are ridiculously low .
I estimate that Euro 750 million in the first year , Euro 500 million in the second year and Euro 250 million in the third year would do the trick .
( if Romania and Moldova were included the figures would be slightly higher ) .
these figures are well within range of pledges already made by the EU for the Stability Pact and they could be easily accommodated within the confines of the Berlin Accord on the EU budget for 2000-2005 if EU member states agree to a reallocation of unspent funds .
budgetary support in the context of a Customs Union would be a more effective way to disburse EU funds than conventional methods .
this three-point program would lay the ground for economic resurgence .
it would remove two major sources of corruption and inefficiency : the customs service and the misuse of public funds in general .
it would create a trade area large enough to generate both local and foreign investment .
the Deutsche Mark , already widely used in the region , now functions as the de facto common currency .
any ban on its use should be lifted to make borders irrelevant for trade and investment .
improved economic prospects and the strengthening of institutions , in turn , would have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the Balkans .
Serbia has climbed part of the way out of the abyss .
success in peacefully removing a tyrant has set in motion a process of national renewal .
but that process has a long way to go .
the opposition inherited a bankrupt country whose institutions are in ruins .
the population , frustrated by ever deepening impoverishment and isolation , is beginning to question what happened over the past decade in Serbia .
people are asking about crimes committed by the Milosevic regime against Serbs .
they must begin to come to terms with the crimes committed against others - in Croatia , Bosnia and Kosovo .
once that process is underway , many problems that now seem intractable will be resolved more easily .
Kostunica ’ s election as President of Yugoslavia amounts to an incomplete revolution : many of the old guard are still in place .
the momentum created by Milosevic ’ s overthrow needs to be maintained .
Milosevic was overthrown in the hope of ending Serbia ’ s isolation .
Europe must now fulfill its promise .
if the French Presidency fails to seize the moment in Zagreb , an historic opportunity will be lost .
Prague – As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union , I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain ’ s infamous description of Czechoslovakia as “ a faraway country of which we know little . ”
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld ’ s misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between “ new and old ” Europe contributed to the re-emergence of that disdainful attitude .
the reality is that there is no such thing as “ old and new ” Europe , and there never was .
the break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old .
we Czechs are 100 % European , and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe .
indeed , our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union , like our freedom , is so comparatively new .
so no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union .
on the contrary , events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity – true union – will be needed .
the primary , and most pressing , of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU .
unfortunately , conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve .
the type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread , because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe ’ s young people , who are seeking jobs at a time when hard-pressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few .
it will fall to the Union , once again , to help transform despair into hope .
we Czechs know something about this , as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990 ’ s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness .
to contain today ’ s financial and economic crisis , Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point .
the very existence of our Union , and particularly of the euro , has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the 1930 ’ s – the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn .
but we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check .
for now , EU governments ’ coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals .
even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate .
although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times , its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro .
these rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth , and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen .
the second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia .
a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PCA ) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated .
those negotiations should have begun seriously last year , but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold .
now those talks have resumed , but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically .
Russia ’ s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members .
the collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia ’ s budget , and lack of investment in the country ’ s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted .
until now , Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU , because two-thirds of Russia ’ s exports to the Union comprise natural resources , which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides .
given the stark changes in economic conditions , however , it is now in Russia ’ s national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business , for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal .
Moreover , without a new PCA , individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia .
indeed , many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia ’ s closest friend in the Union .
but the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members , and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole . only a rules-based EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia .
Europe ’ s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rules-based multilateralism , important as that undoubtedly is , but its unity .
when the Georgia crisis erupted , Europe united around a single position on Russia ’ s withdrawal .
it is the Czech Republic ’ s task , and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own , to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward .
during the 1990 ’ s , the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect . it would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms .
we , like all EU presidencies , will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate .
PRINCETON – What we are doing to our planet , to our children and grandchildren , and to the poor , by our heedless production of greenhouse gases , is one of the great moral wrongs of our age .
on October 24 , you can stand up against this injustice .
October 24 is 350 Day .
the name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that , according to Jim Hansen , perhaps the world ’ s leading climate scientist , we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change .
it is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm , and is rising by two ppm each year .
the need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming – denounced as “ alarmist ” when they were first made just a few years ago – have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative .
we are approaching a point of no return , at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet , no matter what we do .
the melting of arctic ice is one example .
four hundred years ago , explorers sought the legendary “ Northeast Passage ” across the north of Europe and Russia to China .
they found the arctic ice impenetrable , and soon gave up their quest .
this year , commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage .
that is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time .
but ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming .
they are themselves a cause of further warming : ice and snow reflect the sun ’ s rays .
an ice-free surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice . in other words , our greenhouse gas emissions have , by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice , created a feedback loop that will generate more warming , and melt more ice , even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow .
other feedback loops pose a similar danger .
in Siberia , vast quantities of methane , an extremely potent greenhouse gas , are locked up in what used to be called “ permafrost ” – regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen .
but areas that used to be frozen are now thawing , releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming – and to further thawing , which releases more methane .
developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is .
at the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September , President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that , while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem , its greatest impact will probably be on Africa , which has few resources to cope with the challenge .
Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions , and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs .
the money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid , but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated : far more than their fair share of our atmosphere ’ s capacity to absorb our waste gases .
Sri Lanka took a similar stance , using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in 2008 , environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than 2,172 kilograms per person .
in fact , the world ’ s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms , or more than double the permissible limit .
but , while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit , Sri Lankan emissions were , at 660 kilograms , well below it .
as Sri Lanka ’ s government pointed out , “ That means low-emitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent . ”
this situation is an injustice of vast proportions , reminiscent of – and arguably much worse than – the now-repudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century .
the task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December .
many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change , but what most of them regard as “ strong action ” will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm .
in some countries , including the United States , there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps .
on October 24 , people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm of CO2 .
there will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas , where the glaciers are melting , and scuba divers at Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef , which is threatened by climate change .
churches will ring bells 350 times , 350 cyclists will circle towns , and , in many places , 350 trees will be planted .
Atwww.350.org you can find out what is happening near you and join in , or put your own idea online .
but don ’ t just sit back and hope that others will do enough to make an impact .
one day your grandchildren will ask you : what did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time ?
when I was seven years old , in 1960 , my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the meaning of 8 May 1945 , the day when Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe .
we were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on D-Day , 6 June 1944 .
one evening , I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past .
I have forgotten the details of their conversation , but I can still hear my grandmother ’ s sigh of relief when she said “ Thank God we lost that war ! ”
from a child ’ s perspective , it wasn ’ t self-evident that losing was a good thing .
but of course , my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation .
the more I have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago , the clearer I have seen another , less obvious dimension in what she said : it is “ we ” who lost the war .
collectively , the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called “ Nazis ” – Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans , and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually .
in today ’ s Germany , an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation – not only for Europe , but also for Germany itself .
compared to public opinion in 1960 , that ’ s certainly an enormous progress .
but paradoxically , it may also contain an element of forgetfulness , because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat .
to use my grandmother ’ s parlance , it is not “ us ” who were the liberators , but “ them ” .
the way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself .
this is what the term “ politics of memory ” is meant to indicate .
and this is why it doesn ’ t matter whether the relevant events happened 60 years ago ( as World War II ) , 90 years ( as in the case of the Armenian genocide ) or even 600 years ( such as the battle of Kosovo in 1389 ) .
a violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present , as can be observed in the current dispute between China and South Korea on one side , and Japan on the other .
a war of memories , in turn , may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future .
former perpetrators often try to de-legitimize their former victims ’ moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves .
therefore , the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German “ politics of memory ” than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be .
Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed “ Dresden ’ s Holocaust of bombs . ”
Fortunately , their propaganda campaign has been a failure .
although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent at an individual level , there can be no doubt it was morally imperative that Germany be defeated collectively .
on the left side of the German political spectrum , the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged .
however , it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result .
left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact .
its slogan “ Never again war ! ” is only half the truth – the other half is “ Never again appeasement ! ” 8 May 1945 was not “ zero hour , ” as a popular saying in Germany goes .
it had an antecedent , that is , a lack of pre-emptive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany during the 1930 ’ s .
there is yet another lesson to be learned .
yes , 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively .
but for millions of Central and East Europeans , liberation was followed by Stalin ’ s oppressive regime .
the current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia , with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on 9 May this year , reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility .
the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty , the so-called Hitler-Stalin pact , concluded in August 1939 , had been supplemented by a secret appendix dividing the border states Finland , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland and Romania into spheres of interest for the two parties .
but excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem .
when Chancellor Schröder travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations , he should bear in mind Nazi Germany ’ s contribution to the Baltic tragedy .
on 8 May this year , public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget .
they will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned , history is bound to repeat itself .
all this is perfectly true .
but personally , I will also remember my grandmother ’ s sentence “ Thank God we lost that war ! ” Thank God – and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe ’ s liberty .
Cambridge – It may take a few months or a couple of years , but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today ’ s crisis .
the world economy , however , is unlikely to look the same .
even with the worst of the crisis over , we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world , one in which international trade grows at a slower pace , there is less external finance , and rich countries ’ appetite for running large current-account deficits is significantly diminished .
will this spell doom for developing countries ?
not necesarily .
growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants .
first comes growth driven by foreign borrowing .
second is growth as a by-product of commodity booms .
third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products .
the first two models are at greater risk than the third .
but we should not lose sleep over them , because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable .
what should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group .
these countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today ’ s new realities .
the first two growth models invariably come to a bad end .
foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while , but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy .
the problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction , but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth , based on overvalued currencies and investments in non-traded goods and services , such as housing and construction .
growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts , for similar reasons . commodity prices tend to move in cycles .
when they are high , they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other , non-traditional tradables .
Moreover , commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions , leading to costly struggles for resource rents , which are rarely invested wisely .
so it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady , long-term growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy : promoting diversification into manufactured and other “ modern ” goods .
by capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other non-primary products , these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-productivity activities .
their governments pursued not just good “ fundamentals ” ( e.g. , macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation ) , but also what might be called “ productivist ” policies : undervalued currencies , industrial policies , and financial controls .
China exemplified this approach .
its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods .
in recent years , China also got hooked on a large trade surplus vis-à-vis the US – the counterpart of its undervalued currency .
but it wasn ’ t just China .
countries that had been growing rapidly in the run-up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade surpluses ( or very small deficits ) .
these countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows , because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies .
it is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances – typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship – played a major contributing role in the great crash .
global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current-account imbalances in the future .
but a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services .
in the past , this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits .
this is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middle-income developing countries .
so , are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other ?
will developing countries ’ need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world ’ s intolerance of trade imbalances ?
there is in fact no inherent conflict , once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses , nor even the volume of their exports .
what matters is their output of modern industrial goods ( and services ) , which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously .
maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods ; but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption – which is why it generates a trade surplus .
by encouraging industrial production directly , it is possible to have the upside without the downside .
there are many ways that this can be done , including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure .
explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument .
the key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate ( in real terms ) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly .
so the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances .
their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood .
one such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate .
another is that external policy actors ( for example , the World Trade Organization ) will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate .
greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances .
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism , especially with the military response to terrorism .
American foreign policy reflects that obsession .
this year , the US will spend around $ 450 billion for the military , including the costs of the Iraq War , while it will spend no more than $ 15 billion to overcome global poverty , global environmental degradation , and global diseases .
in other words , US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity , global public health , and a sustainable environment .
throughout 2003 , the world lived with Bush &apos;s obsession .
debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy , and took up almost the entire UN agenda .
the war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives , such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed .
at the same time , Bush &apos;s emphasis on a one-dimensional , militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world , leading to increased terrorism in Turkey , North Africa , Saudi Arabia , and Southeast Asia .
the nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy .
focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues , and emphasizing the military response to it , will not bring prosperity and peace , or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks .
while 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11 , 2001 , in Africa 8,000 innocent children die every day from malaria .
yet malaria is preventable and treatable .
the problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention ( bed nets ) and treatments ( anti-malarial medicines ) that could save millions of children every year .
the US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africa &apos;s malaria in a year .
as 2003 draws to a close , it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive , failing approach of America &apos;s government .
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world : poverty , lack of access to safe water and sanitation , vulnerability to disease , and climate change .
ironically , President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word .
he declared in London recently that &quot; the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required . &quot;
yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges .
for example , at the International Conference on Financing for Development , in Monterrey , Mexico in March 2002 , America signed the Monterrey Consensus , which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.7 % of national income .
that would bring an additional $ 60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the US--approximately what it spent on Iraq this year .
yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise .
there are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled .
the US promised action to fight man-made climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCC ) in 1992 .
it has so far failed to act .
America also promised--in the Doha Declaration in 2001--to open its markets to the world &apos;s poorest countries .
yet at Cancun , Mexico earlier this summer , it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies .
the list goes on and on .
at the Millennium Assembly in 2000 , the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty , yet it has taken few steps in that direction .
at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 , America committed itself to protect global ecosystems , yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then .
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN .
but because the US is the richest , most powerful country in the world , its neglect is devastating .
if the US really wants to undercut terrorism , it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism , poverty , and environmental degradation , and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere .
but the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses .
the US represents just 5 % of the world &apos;s population , and just one vote of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly .
poor countries , especially the democracies of the developing world--Brazil , South Africa , India , Mexico , Ghana , the Philippines--should say , &quot; We need to act on the issues that concern us , not just on the issues that concern the US . &quot;
what the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American willfulness .
Turkey &apos;s seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise .
the Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkey &apos;s conflict between its &quot; strategic alliance &quot; with America and its drive to join the EU .
the elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the then-ruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU .
some liberal elements of that &quot; secular &quot; coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament .
after coming to power , the AKP &apos;s leaders , former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as &quot; conservative democrats , &quot; energetically engaged with the US , the EU , and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq , from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey .
having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkey &apos;s &quot; secular &quot; state and recognizing that human rights must be protected across-the-board , the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West .
the US , preoccupied with the supposed specter of a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; between Islam and the West , saw the AKP &apos;s modern , westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey .
today , both &quot; conservative democrats &quot; and liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU , while opponents include extreme nationalists , of both left and right , as well as some elements of the &quot; secular &quot; establishment .
the Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December &apos;s summit of EU leaders .
instead , the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again , putting off formal negotiations that , in any case , may take years to complete .
Europe &apos;s persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary .
the Americans want full EU membership for Turkey--a longstanding NATO member and close American ally--while Europeans complain about the Turkish military &apos;s domestic political role .
the paradox is that , by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkey &apos;s options , Europe may end up reinforcing Turkey &apos;s status as a military outpost of the US .
at least , that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq .
then , despite massive US pressure , Turkey &apos;s parliament unexpectedly rejected the government &apos;s proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory .
Turkey &apos;s refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war .
the Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis , an effort no current EU member could have contemplated .
Parliament &apos;s rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate .
suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the government &apos;s true &quot; Islamic &quot; character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament , the Republican People &apos;s Party--founded by Atatürk and still fully &quot; secularist &quot; --voted against the plan .
likewise , other elements of Turkey &apos;s secular establishment , including the President and the military leadership , either opposed or were lukewarm , at best , to the idea of war in Iraq .
Turkey &apos;s military initially remained silent on the issue , uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold .
by contrast , the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus .
their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives : either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state , or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship .
they chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament , which , in voting down the US plan , reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war .
only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops .
in fact , the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US , consult with the Turkish military and President , and share all information with the public and parliament .
walking a fine line in what was essentially a lose-lose situation , the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament .
the outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally .
after the US military action in Iraq , the tables may be turning in surprising ways .
as America establishes itself in Iraq , Turkey &apos;s geopolitical military significance may decline .
yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkey &apos;s symbolic importance as a role model .
this shift in Turkey &apos;s strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform .
with careful management , Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe , while rebuilding its relationship with America .
Cambridge – This year is likely to mark a make-or-break ordeal for the euro .
the eurozone ’ s survival demands a credible solution to its long-running sovereign-debt crisis , which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances – &amp; nbsp ; external and fiscal – &amp; nbsp ; which are at the heart of that crisis .
the crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone .
from 1996 to 2010 , unit labor costs in Germany increased by just 8 % , and by 13 % in France .
compare that to 24 % in Portugal , 35 % in Spain , 37 % in Italy , and a whopping 59 % in Greece .
the result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries , a problem compounded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern Europe ( and France ) – much of it owed to foreign creditors .
does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone ?
suppose , for example , that Portugal were to leave and re-introduce the escudo .
the ensuing exchange-rate devaluation would immediately lower the price of Portugal ’ s exports , raise its import prices , stimulate the economy , and bring about much-needed growth .
but a euro exit would be a messy affair .
the resulting turmoil could very well trump any short-term gains in competitiveness from devaluation .
there is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require southern Europe ’ s troubled economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates .
it involves increasing the value-added tax while cutting payroll taxes .
our recent research demonstrates that such a “ fiscal devaluation ” has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on GDP , consumption , employment , and inflation .
a currency devaluation works by making imports more costly and exports cheaper .
a VAT / payroll-tax swap would do exactly the same thing .
an increase in VAT raises the price of imported goods , as foreign firms face a higher tax .
to ensure that domestic firms do not have an incentive to raise prices , an increase in VAT needs to be accompanied by a cut in payroll taxes .
Moreover , since exports are exempt from VAT , the price of domestic exports will fall .
the desired competitiveness effects of exchange-rate devaluation can thus be had while staying in the euro .
this policy can also help on the fiscal front .
as is true of an exchange-rate devaluation , the positive impact on growth of an increase in competitiveness can strengthen the fiscal position by raising tax revenues .
Moreover , an important advantage of fiscal devaluations is that they generate additional revenues in proportion to the country ’ s trade deficit .
for countries that are suffering from weak competitiveness and , as a consequence , running trade deficits , this typically means more revenues , especially in the short run .
like exchange-rate devaluations , fiscal devaluations create winners and losers .
both act as a wealth levy : inflation means that bondholders suffer a real loss in proportion to their wealth and the size of the devaluation .
if taxes on capital are not adjusted , holders of domestic stocks suffer a comparable loss .
by contrast , many transfers , such as unemployment benefits , health benefits , and public pensions , are indexed to inflation , and thus maintain their real value .
the same is true of minimum wages .
these distributive effects play an important role in the politics of exchange-rate devaluations , and most of these effects appear in fiscal devaluations as well .
fiscal devaluations already have some advocates .
indeed , French President Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s government just announced one .
and concerns that a fiscal devaluation will conflict with euro rules can be met by simply pointing out that Germany ’ s government carried one out in 2007 , though by another name , when it raised VAT from 16 % to 19 % and cut employers ’ contribution to social insurance , from 6.5 % to 4.2 % .
in short , there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchange-rate devaluation that can address southern Europe ’ s short-term competitiveness problems .
to be sure , feasible fiscal devaluations would be limited in size .
but , together with debt restructuring , accommodative monetary policy , liquidity support from the European Central Bank , and much-required structural reforms , they can help to put these troubled economies on a sound footing without a euro breakup or a major austerity-induced recession .
Copenhagen – Amid a growing wave of concern about climate change , many countries – including Brazil , Australia , the United States , and the members of the European Union – passed laws in the 2000 ’ s outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs .
the intention was understandable : if everyone in the world exchanged most light bulbs for energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) , we could save 3.5 % of all electricity , or 1 % of our CO2 emissions .
the current attempt by Republicans in the US Congress to roll back America ’ s effort to ban incandescent bulbs has revived this discussion .
many contend that the agenda is being driven by knuckle-dragging climate-change deniers .
but it ’ s worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to tackle global warming .
let ’ s be clear : we do need to tackle climate change .
but this does not mean that we should just cut all emissions .
burning fossil fuels also has significant benefits , and we should weigh those benefits against the costs .
a tax on carbon should be equivalent to its damage .
the best estimate of this is about $ 7 / ton of CO2 or $ 0.06 / gallon of gasoline ( € 0.015 / liter ) .
most developed countries already have a tax of this size ( and often much larger ) on electricity and fossil fuels , although this also incorporates the costs of air pollution and supply insecurity .
while CFLs are more expensive to buy , they are much cheaper over their lifespan , because they use much less energy ( even more so with the cost of CO2 factored into taxes on electricity ) .
thus , on a straightforward cost-benefit basis , it seems to make sense for most people to switch from incandescent bulbs to the new , greener technology .
this is what is great about technological solutions to climate change : if an alternative option is cheaper , people will start using it .
my household uses CFLs , and I enjoy knowing that I am causing fewer CO2 emissions and spending less money .
why , then , is it even necessary to outlaw the old bulbs ?
the reason is that monetary cost is only one factor .
many people find it annoying that CFLs take time to “ warm up . ”
or they believe that their light is “ funny . ”
or they worry that the bulbs can spread poisonous mercury if they break .
for some people , energy-efficient bulbs can trigger epileptic seizures and migraines .
the up-front cost is a factor , too , especially for those on low budgets .
and in places where lights are not used very often , a lower-price incandescent bulb can cost less overall than the energy-efficient alternative .
you might imagine that people could choose the right light bulbs for themselves .
but proponents of phasing out access to incandescent bulbs argue that they know better .
as US Energy Secretary Steven Chu put it recently , “ We are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money . ”
setting aside other possible objections to this view , there is the problem that it presumes that all incandescent bulbs are worth less than $ 7 / ton of CO2 .
this is clearly not true for those who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures because of the new bulbs , or for those who are seriously worried about mercury , or for those who have other reasons for preferring incandescent bulbs .
the solution should be to focus on improving the technology – making the lights safer , brighter , warm up faster , and save more energy , so that more people will replace more of their lights .
but it is not just light bulbs that policymakers have tried to ban .
EU parliamentarians voted overwhelmingly to outlaw patio heaters , which one MEP declared to be “ a luxury the planet cannot afford . ”
who decides when something is luxurious ?
and where does this end ?
should we outlaw air conditioning or television satellite boxes because some people find them luxurious ?
should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to move us from A to B with fewer CO2 emissions ?
it makes sense to reflect the cost of CO2 ( among many other factors ) in the price paid to drive our cars or heat our patios ; but when the phase-out proceeds more slowly than some lawmakers wish , a ban is not the right solution .
real reductions in carbon emissions will occur only when better technology makes it worthwhile for individuals and businesses to change their behavior .
CFLs and other advances can take us part of the way , but there are massive technological hurdles to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than greener alternatives .
this is where a lot of policymakers get it wrong .
governments talk far too much about setting a relatively high carbon tax on emissions , while focusing far too little on ensuring a meaningful increase in research and development to bring about necessary breakthroughs .
limiting access to the ‘ wrong ’ light bulbs or patio heaters , ultimately , is not the right path .
we will only solve global warming by ensuring that alternative technologies are better than our current options .
then , people the world over will choose to use them .
Tokyo – 2009 was a good year for China .
the Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession .
American President Barack Obama visited China , more in the spirit of a supplicant to an imperial court than the leader of the world ’ s greatest superpower .
even the Copenhagen summit on climate change ended just the way China wanted : failure in its attempt to commit China , or any other industrial nation , to making significant cuts in carbon emissions , with the United States getting the blame .
the Chinese government , under the Communist Party , has every reason to feel confident .
so why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to 11 years in prison , just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to one-party rule ?
Liu was co-author in 2008 of a petition , Charter 08 , signed by thousands of Chinese , calling for basic rights to be respected . Liu is not a violent rebel .
his opinions , in articles published on the Internet , are entirely peaceful .
yet he was jailed for “ inciting subversion of state power . ”
the notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd .
and yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him , to prevent others from expressing similar views .
why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions , or even peaceful petitions , so dangerous ?
perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks .
without legitimacy , no government can rule with any sense of confidence .
there are many ways to legitimize political arrangements .
liberal democracy is only a recent invention .
Hereditary monarchy , often backed by divine authority , has worked in the past .
and some modern autocrats , such as Robert Mugabe , have been bolstered by their credentials as national freedom fighters .
China has changed a great deal in the last century , but it has remained the same in one respect : it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics .
legitimacy is not based on the give and take , the necessary compromises , and the wheeling and dealing that form the basis of an economic concept of politics such as that which underpins liberal democracy .
instead , the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief , imposed from above , in ideological orthodoxy .
in imperial China , this meant Confucian orthodoxy .
the ideal of the Confucian state is “ harmony . ”
if all people conform to a particular set of beliefs , including moral codes of behavior , conflicts will disappear .
the ruled , in this ideal system , will naturally obey their rulers , just as sons obey their fathers .
after the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century , Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism .
Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals , because it was bookish , introduced a modern moral orthodoxy , and was based , like Confucianism , on a promise of perfect harmony .
ultimately , in the Communist utopia , conflicts of interests would melt away .
Chairman Mao ’ s rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism .
this orthodoxy , however , was also destined to fade away .
few Chinese , even in the top ranks of the Communist Party , are convinced Marxists anymore .
this left an ideological vacuum , swiftly filled in the 1980 ’ s by greed , cynicism , and corruption .
out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China , collectively known as “ Tiananmen . ”
Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in 1989 for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom .
soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen , a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism : Chinese nationalism .
only one-party rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation .
the Communist Party represented China ’ s destiny as a great power .
to doubt this was not just mistaken , but unpatriotic , even “ anti-Chinese . ”
from this perspective , Liu Xiaobo ’ s critical views were indeed subversive .
they cast doubt on the official orthodoxy , and thus on the legitimacy of the state .
to wonder , as many have , why the Chinese regime refused to negotiate with the students in 1989 – or to find some accommodation with its critics today – is to misunderstand the nature of religious politics .
negotiation , compromise , and accommodation are the marks of economic politics , where every deal has its price .
by contrast , those who rule according to a shared belief cannot afford to negotiate , for that would undermine the belief itself .
this is not to say that the economic concept of politics is utterly strange to the Chinese – or , for that matter , that the religious notion of politics is unknown in the democratic West .
but the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics .
these things can change .
other Confucian societies , such as South Korea , Taiwan , and Japan , now have thriving liberal democracies , and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China .
but external pressure is unlikely to bring it about .
many non-Chinese , including me , have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo .
one hopes that this will lend comfort to him , and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views .
but it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism .
until China is released from the grip of religious politics , Liu ’ s ideals are unlikely to take root .
this does not bode well for China , or , indeed , for the rest of the world .
as America debates whether or not to invade Iraq , fears that the country &apos;s economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion ; with that , worries about the health of the global economy are growing , too .
a consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economy &apos;s growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come .
can the situation get worse ?
yes , it can : much worse .
a number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time :
huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan &apos;s misguided tax cuts of 1981 converted America from the world &apos;s largest creditor into the world &apos;s largest debtor .
today , these deficits set new records by the month ;
America &apos;s appallingly low savings rate .
when American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed , this was understandable ; individual Americans were becoming richer without savings , so why bother ?
today &apos;s savings rate , while it has increased slightly , still finds America at the bottom of the world &apos;s savings league tables ;
lax accounting standards .
the Arthur Anderson , Enron , and WorldCom scandals didn &apos;t emerge out of thin air , but had their origins in the mid-1990s , when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters .
bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble ; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities ; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today &apos;s excess capacity .
to this old brew , new ingredients have been added , notably the most rapid change in a nation &apos;s fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen .
in a &quot; now you see it , now you don &apos;t &quot; move only a magician should love , the $ 3 trillion , ten year ( non social security ) US budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a gapingdeficit of $ 2 trillion dollars .
of course , excuses are at hand : the magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold .
excuses , excuses .
as the old saying goes : don &apos;t count your chickens before they hatch .
the Bush Administration not only counted its chickens , it sold them forward !
to anyone with decent eyesight , it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense .
clear , too , was the fact that , in promoting its tax cuts , the Bush Administration was engaging ( on a multi-billion dollar scale ) in dishonest , Enron-like accounting .
so if things are so bad now , how can they get worse ?
here &apos;s a plausible scenario .
to finance its trade deficit , America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day .
when America was the only safe haven for global investors , this was easy .
but America today appears less safe .
the combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts , lack of confidence in America &apos;s economic policy management ( compounded by the mounting deficits ) , and America &apos;s soft underlying economic fundamentals , has dented the US economy &apos;s global reputation .
as foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect , the dollar will weaken .
as the dollar weakens , America looks even less safe .
so a rush to the door begins .
while a weak dollar may be good for exports , a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence .
eventually , even the almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement , especially given Bush &apos;s proposed risky experiments with the social security system .
at that point , Americans will join the stampede out of their economy .
why shouldn &apos;t they ?
they &apos;re free to choose where to put their money .
Europe &apos;s stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative .
but this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe .
a weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports .
the European Central Bank , fixated on inflation , will be slow to lower interest rates , and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses .
Europe will join America in a downturn , reinforcing America &apos;s decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral .
I am not predicting that this will happen .
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy : a tax cut that might made minimal sense when itseemedthat the US had a multi-trillion dollar surplus no longer makes any sense at all .
the Bush Administration should admit this , and redesign a tax program to strengthen the economy by making the country live within its means .
President Bush could even stabilize the economy , offering better unemployment benefits to provide needed stimulus if the downturn continues .
America is strong , and the global economy is strong .
should the disastrous events contemplated here occur , a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes .
downturns , of course , can never be fully prevented .
we can , however , decrease their frequency ; we can make them shallower ; we can ensure that fewer people are hurt and that those that get hurt are better protected .
sadly , we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences .
last winter , America &apos;s central bank - the Federal Reserve - was busy patting itself on the back .
the Fed &apos;s cut in its basic interest rate to 1.75 % per year seemed to have worked : the recession was ending .
despite sobered expectations about the high-tech revolution &apos;s impact on productivity and profits , as well as the jitters inspired by the terror attack on the World Trade Center , American businesses , it was believed , would soon start investing again big-time because borrowing money at 1.75 % was too good a deal to pass up .
by late spring , those expectations had disintegrated alongside the collapse of Enron , WorldCom , and Arthur Andersen .
suddenly , everyone doubted the integrity of the financial accounts of American companies .
suddenly , everyone saw just how much America &apos;s system of corporate surveillance and control had deteriorated during the bubble of the 1990s .
the American stock market fell 15-20 % below its winter levels .
spreads between the interest rate at which America &apos;s government could borrow and the interest rates at which America &apos;s corporations could borrow widened .
suddenly , the Fed stopped congratulating itself : a 1.75 % interest rate might be the right interest rate to fuel a recovery when the Dow-Jones stock market index stands at 10,000 , but not when the Dow-Jones index stands at 8,500 .
throughout the summer , corporate investment news remained disappointing .
more and more analysts began to speak about the possibility of a &quot; double dip &quot; recession .
yet throughout all this , the Federal Reserve remained passive .
the short-term interest rates it controlled didn &apos;t budge .
only in mid-August did the Fed hint that interest rates might be cut .
the informal and unofficial rationale leaking out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts .
today , however , the real threats to the majority of the world &apos;s population stems from dangers almost unknown back then : poverty , hunger , population growth , migration , the environment , and the like .
for the UN to meet these challenges , its very structure must change .
two new councils , each with comparable power to the Security Council , are needed : a Social Council and an Economic Council .
the IMF , World Bank , and WTO should not only report to , but be dependent upon this new UN reformed structure .
why are these new bodies needed ?
the world cannot do without rules ; it cannot move forward against our age &apos;s most pressing problems without defined legal rules and the institutions that regulate international law .
because these institutions do not exist , the UN must now invent them .
of course some rules , such as rules governing the promulgation of trade sanctions , now exist within , say , the WTO .
these rules , however , are but steps in the right direction : steps toward socially and ecologically sustainable free trade and against protectionism , especially that often practiced by rich countries .
across the board , more global rules are needed so that global efforts to confront poverty , disease , and mass migration can be made consistent , predictable and most of all effective .
we have the Rome Statute of International Criminal Code ; we are heading for an innovative guide to best practice on how civil society organizations can best contribute to the work of the UN ; and we now have a large coalition , far beyond NATO , combatting terrorism .
I am grateful that one of the reactions to September 11th was , if I am not mistaken , a somewhat changed attitude within the USA vis-à-vis the UN .
but it is of a paramount importance that these kinds of change , namely , to incorporate real power into the structure of the UN , make more progress .
in dangerous times such as these , the world &apos;s peoples need to prove their solidarity .
the large coalition now fighting terrorism is one way to demonstrate this .
but solidarity also must be recognized within the real power structures of the UN .
the Secretary General convocation of a ``Dialogue of Civilizations &apos; &apos; is but a start here .
far more needs to be done .
the institution of Social and Economic Councils at the UN would mark an enormous step in the right direction .
I have tried to present the ideas outlined here not only to the General Assembly but also to the permanent members of the Security Council .
I have also been invited to present them to the US Senate .
so far , none of those discussions have proved to be very fruitful .
but just as the time is coming when the US will to come see the UN as indispensable , the Security Council and its members will come to see the creation of new bodies within the UN not as rivals , but as the only means for the world &apos;s people , in solidarity , to confront the myriad social and economic problems that they face .
new YORK – The solution to manmade climate change depends on the transition to electricity production that , unlike burning oil , natural gas , and coal , emits little or no carbon dioxide – the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming .
low-carbon electricity can be produced by solar , nuclear , and wind energy , or by coal-burning power plants that capture and store their CO2 emissions .
the policy problem is simple .
coal is a cheaper and more easily used energy source than the alternatives .
it is cheap because it is plentiful .
it is easier to use than wind or solar power because it can produce electricity around the clock , without reliance on weather conditions .
to save the planet , we need to induce power suppliers to adopt low-carbon energy sources despite coal ’ s lower price and greater ease of use .
the obvious way is to tax coal , or to require power plants to have permits to use coal , and to set the tax or permit price high enough to induce a shift towards the low-carbon alternatives .
suppose coal produces electricity at a cost of $ 0.06 per kilowatt-hour , while solar power costs $ 0.16 / kilowatt-hour .
the tax on coal-based electricity would have to be $ 0.10 / kilowatt-hour .
in that case , consumers would pay $ 0.16 / kilowatt-hour for either coal or solar .
the utilities would then shift to low-carbon solar power .
the switchover , however , would more than double the electricity bill in this example .
politicians are loath to impose such a tax , fearing a political backlash .
for years , this has stymied progress in the United States towards a low-carbon economy .
yet several European countries have successfully introduced the idea of a “ feed-in tariff , ” which provides the core of a politically acceptable long-term solution .
a feed-in tariff subsidizes the low-carbon energy source rather than taxing the high-carbon energy source .
in our example , the government would pay a subsidy of $ 0.10 / kilowatt-hour to the solar-power plant to make up the difference between the consumer price of $ 0.06 and the production cost of $ 0.16 .
the consumer price remains unchanged , but the government must somehow pay for the subsidy .
here is another way .
suppose that we levy a small tax on existing coal power plants in order to pay for the solar subsidy , and then gradually raise consumers ’ electricity bills as more and more solar plants are phased in .
the price charged to consumers would rise gradually from $ 0.06 / kilowatt-hour to the full cost of $ 0.16 / kilowatt-hour , but over a phase-in period of , say , 40 years ( the lifespan of the newest of today ’ s coal plants ) .
assume that as of 2010 , the entire electricity system is coal-based , and that the electricity price paid by the consumers is $ 0.06 / kilowatt-hour .
by 2014 , suppose that 10 % of the 40-year transition to solar power has been achieved .
the consumer price is raised 10 % of the way from $ 0.06 to $ 0.16 , thus reaching $ 0.07 / kilowatt-hour .
the coal tax for 2014 is then set at $ 0.01 / kilowatt-hour , which is just enough to pay the needed solar subsidy of $ 0.09 / kilowatt-hour .
solar producers fully cover their costs of $ 0.16 / kilowatt-hour , since they sell power to the consumers at $ 0.07 / kilowatt-hour and receive a subsidy of $ 0.09 / kilowatt-hour .
a small coal tax can support a large solar subsidy .
suppose , further , that by 2030 the transition to a low-carbon economy is halfway completed .
the consumer price for electricity is now set at $ 0.11 , exactly halfway between $ 0.06 and $ 0.16 .
the coal tax is now raised to $ 0.05 / kilowatt-hour , just enough to cover the solar subsidy of $ 0.05 / kilowatt-hour .
once again , the solar producers cover their costs exactly , since the subsidy of $ 0.05 / kilowatt-hour closes the gap between the consumer price ( $ 0.11 / kilowatt-hour ) and the producer cost ( $ 0.16 / kilowatt-hour ) .
let us presume , finally , that by 2050 , all electricity production has made the transition to low-carbon energy sources .
the consumer price finally reaches $ 0.16 / kilowatt-hour , enough to cover the full cost of solar power without a further subsidy .
this approach allows higher consumer electricity prices to be phased in gradually , yet establishes strong , immediate incentives for adopting solar power .
Moreover , the government budget is balanced every year , since the coal tax pays for the solar subsidy .
the actual transformation in the coming years will have one major advantage compared to this illustration .
today ’ s solar power plants might cost an extra $ 0.10 / kilowatt-hour compared to coal , but such plants will be much less costly in the future because of improved technology .
thus , the magnitude of subsidies needed in a decade or two will be lower than they are today .
energy debates in the US , Australia , and other countries have centered so far on introducing a cumbersome cap-and-trade permit system .
every major user of fossil fuel would need to buy permits to emit CO2 , and those permits would trade in a special marketplace .
the market price of the permits would be equivalent to paying a tax on CO2 emissions .
unfortunately , cap-and-trade systems are difficult to manage and don ’ t give clear signals about the future price of permits .
Europe has adopted such a system , but other parts of the world have repeatedly rejected it .
in fact , Europe ’ s biggest successes in promoting low-carbon energy have come from its feed-in tariffs , and carbon taxes in some countries , rather than its cap-and-trade system .
the time has come for the US , China , India , and other major economies to declare how they will foster their own transition to a low-carbon economy .
a small and gradually rising carbon tax that funds a feed-in tariff system could win political support in the US .
it could also help to foster consensus among the major coal-based economies , including China and India .
there really are effective long-term solutions to manmade climate change that are politically acceptable and feasible to implement .
it is time to embrace them .
an unusual meeting of scientists took place in Paris this summer , when scientists gathered to brainstorm about the need for a new science , one that could be as revolutionary as Einstein ’ s insights were a century ago .
most scientists assume that the basics of science are known .
in terms of big challenges , the conventional wisdom is that few things are left to discover .
the remaining options are said to fall into three groups : “ grand scientific quandaries ” ( such as uniting gravity and electricity into one theory ) which require a huge investment and first world infrastructure ; “ data collection , ” which is the field work associated with archeological digs and biological / genetic surveys ; and “ science-informed problems , ” such as combating AIDS or addressing global warming .
beyond that , many believe the only hard work will be to use existing laws to benefit humankind in new technological ways .
who can argue ?
after all , today ’ s models work .
but an emerging group of scientists points to phenomena that current theories do not address well .
these problems are exceedingly common and artfully avoided because the science that would account for them just doesn ’ t exist .
this missing science would describe processes , and how entire systems evolve .
individual scientific disciplines are understood fairly well .
physics , at least the physics we encounter as ordinary humans , is well mapped .
Chemistry and biochemistry are similarly solid -- there are some things we don ’ t understand about the body , but it is believed that the basic machinery of how cells and molecules interact is known .
slightly apart from these are the new social sciences , which deal with humans and societies .
in each of these areas -- physics , biochemistry and social science -- the theories are mature and largely uncontroversial .
each discipline has its own language and its own separate machinery .
rarely is a scientist an expert in more than one area , because the worlds and languages are so different .
this means that we can ’ t answer complex questions that depend on more than one field .
consider the brain , for example .
this complex organ is composed of molecules that interact using the principles of physics .
that information moves according to the laws of electricity .
there is also a system of specialized cells , and these interact , exchanging chemicals that also convey information .
the interaction between two brains adds another level : here , information is exchanged by means of languages , signs and ideas .
information is at work on each level and comfortable theories explain how the separate ones operate .
but information is being exchanged between the levels as well . there is no science that explains this , even at the most rudimentary level .
to cope with this deficiency , some scientists have tried to reinvent the tools of one level in order to apply them to another .
this leads to such things as a “ language ” at the level of cells and “ energy ” behind organized societies .
sometimes the transplant works well enough , but it does not address the central problem : what is the nature of the information conveyed between each level , and how is it conveyed ?
as it happens , nearly every system in the world is composed of such layers .
a similarly embarrassing lack of understanding about how the whole system works exists in every case .
the group of interdisciplinary scientists that met in Paris is loosely affiliated under the banner “ Foundations of Information Science . ”
they have been working in a distributed collaboration for eight years and come from a range of countries and specialties .
as well as scientists from the relevant disciplines , art theorists , psychiatrists , language experts and philosophers are beginning to participate in the discussion .
most of the group is banking on the “ transplant ” strategy , in which the basic science of one layer is placed in another , tweaked and supplemented in order to be functional .
others think that a whole new approach is required .
they assume that many scientific conventions are accidents of history and new abstractions can be devised .
if the FIS group is lucky , there will also be some radical input from thinkers that do not presently have access to first world infrastructure .
independent thinking is an underestimated factor .
nearly all the activities collected under the banner of “ science ” have developed institutional tendencies that are similar to their economic counterparts .
it is usually assumed that developing economies need to build resources that emulate those in the developed world , but this could actually stifle the most creative thinking .
many scientific disciples are going through a revolution , and a lot of those ideas -- sometimes revolutionary ideas -- are bubbling up from labs and research centers that are unaffiliated with large institutions .
Twenty years of the most advanced thinking for mathematical algorithms came from a Soviet empire starved of computing power .
the cleverest , most literally earth-shattering notions of physics for two generations came not from the expected powerhouses of the day , but from Budapest .
Iran has a tradition of architectural design that has revealed key insights to cognitive scientists .
today , some of the most radical new ideas in second generation artificial intelligence ( so-called “ autonomous agents ” ) are incubating in Prague .
the most creative breakthroughs became famous events .
when Einstein added new abstractions to the language of physics , the identity of space and time changed .
the FIS meeting in July was the unheralded beginning of an attempt to remodel the universe in such a way .
the group identified the gaps that need explanation .
they will expand their pool of thinkers to include scientists from necessarily innovative regions .
following this , they will identify which problems might be solved if this new science is developed .
or if you wish , discovered .
Vienna – US President Barack Obama has injected fresh momentum into efforts – stalled for a decade – to bring about nuclear disarmament .
he has committed himself to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and acknowledges the link between nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states .
Obama has pledged to revitalize the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons .
the non-proliferation regime , of which the NPT is the cornerstone , is in disarray .
the main problems are easily identified .
first , the five main nuclear-weapon states have not taken seriously their NPT obligation to work for nuclear disarmament .
instead , they have insisted that nuclear weapons are essential for their security and continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals .
this naturally robs them of the moral authority to persuade others not to acquire nuclear weapons , which continue to be perceived as a source of power and influence , and an insurance policy against attack .
second , as we have seen in the case of North Korea , there is nothing to stop countries that sign the Treaty from simply walking out after declaring that “ extraordinary events ” have jeopardized their supreme interests .
third , the International Atomic Energy Agency , which is supposed to police the non-proliferation system , is shamefully underfunded .
when it comes to determining whether or not a country is conducting a covert nuclear weapons program , IAEA inspectors often have their hands tied , either because they lack the legal authority to gain access to all the locations they consider necessary , or because the IAEA ’ s analytical laboratories are outdated , or because the Agency does not have adequate access to satellite imagery .
fourth , export controls have failed to prevent the spread of sensitive nuclear technology , not least due to the sophisticated efforts of clandestine networks like the one run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan .
nine countries already have nuclear weapons , and it would be naive to presume that others , particularly in regions of conflict , will not try to get hold of them .
in addition , a number of countries with nuclear energy programs have the capability , if they choose , to manufacture nuclear weapons within a matter of months if their security perceptions change , because they have mastered the critical technology – uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing .
if more countries take this path , it could prove to be the Achilles ’ heel of non-proliferation .
fifth , the international community , spearheaded by the United Nations Security Council , has more often than not been paralyzed in the face of challenges to international security and ineffectual in responding to suspected cases of nuclear proliferation .
these issues will not be resolved overnight .
but there is much that can be done relatively quickly .
the United States and Russia have started negotiations on deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals , which together account for 95 % of the world ’ s 27,000 warheads .
other key steps include bringing into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty ; negotiating a verifiable treaty to end production of fissile material for use in weapons ; radically improving the physical security of nuclear and radioactive materials , which is vital to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists ; and strengthening the IAEA .
last month , I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA ’ s Board of Governors – establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium ( LEU ) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors .
LEU cannot be used to make weapons .
some such mechanism will be essential in the coming decades as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy .
my proposal is to create a physical stockpile of LEU at the disposal of the IAEA as a last-resort reserve for countries with nuclear power programs that face a supply disruption for non-commercial reasons .
this would give countries confidence that they can count on reliable supplies of fuel to run their nuclear power plants , and therefore do not need to develop their own uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing capability .
this could help to avoid a repeat of Iran ’ s experiences after its 1979 revolution , when contracts for fuel and technology for its planned nuclear power program were not honored .
thirty years later , some of the consequences are still being felt .
the LEU would be available to countries in need on the basis of non-political and non-discriminatory criteria .
it would be accessible at market prices to all states in compliance with their nuclear safeguards obligations .
no state would be required to give up the right to develop its own fuel cycle .
the money needed to launch an LEU bank is in place , thanks primarily to a non-governmental organization – the Nuclear Threat Initiative – and initial funding from Warren Buffett .
but this can only be a first step .
it should be followed by an agreement that all new enrichment and reprocessing activities will be placed exclusively under multinational control , and that all existing such facilities will be converted from national to multinational control .
this is a bold idea , but bold ideas are needed now more than ever .
the opportunity to put the nuclear fuel cycle under multinational control was missed 60 years ago because of the Cold War .
the spread of nuclear technology and the growing risk of nuclear terrorism make it imperative that we get it right this time .
on August 8 , 2008 , the world watched with awe the amazing spectacle of the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing .
we saw the electronic unrolling of Chinese scrolls replete with great historic symbols and were mesmerized by dancers creating “ harmony , ” using their bodies as ink brushes .
2008 martial arts students performed millennia-old moves with mechanical precision , while the flying celestials and the galloping torchbearer created a sense of heavenly abode on earth .
there was another time when China dazzled the world at its doorstep : the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , often thought of as China ’ s golden age , when it was truly the “ middle kingdom ” at the center of the universe .
its capital , Chang Àn ( modern day Xìan ) was a world-class city ; visitors came from all over the world and were dazzled by its wealth , beauty , and power .
its emperors used silver from Persia , glass from Europe , precious stones from Central Asia , and gold implements from India .
open , confident , and cosmopolitan , China connected with the world with ease , adopting new ideas , and projecting its own indigenous creations .
it ’ s no wonder that Chinese scholars sometimes refer to today ’ s China era as the new Tang Dynasty .
indeed , when China was awarded the Olympic Games in 2001 , the country ’ s official news agency , Xinhua called it a “ milestone in China ’ s rising international status and a historical event in the great renaissance of the Chinese nation . ”
for seven years , Chinese officials and artists worked tirelessly to make this dream of a “ renaissance ” a glittering reality , and they exceeded all expectations .
but how should we understand the broader implications of the opening ceremony , both for China and the outside world ?
first , the good news .
in keeping with China ’ s recent efforts to project its “ soft ” side , the opening ceremony produced the idea of a historic , but dynamic culture at its best . other than the presence of a few People ’ s Liberation Army soldiers , you would have been hard pressed to find any visible evidence of the reigning communist regime or its founder , Mao Zedong .
equally significant was the projection of China as a nascent leader of the new international cultural order .
the “ Bird ’ s Nest ” stadium was the creation of the multinational design team of Herzog &amp; amp ; de Meuron , with suggestions from the visual artist Ai Weiwei .
many artists involved in the creation of the spectacle , including the fireworks specialist Cai Guo Qiang , the dance star Shen Wei , and the composer Tan Dun , earned their fame primarily in the West .
even Zhang Yimou , the lead impresario for the event , gained fame in the West through his early films chronicling the hard life of a young modern China .
Chinese officials had clearly decided that these diaspora darlings of the international art scene should be now claimed as China ’ s own .
these artists ’ ability to the bridge traditions of East and West and to create a new space for creativity that can transcend the cultural specificities of the past in favor of a new blended future could be squarely associated with China ’ s own global aspirations .
like the artists and their art , the country could elevate itself from the dichotomies of old-new , past-present , and traditional-modern to project an image appropriate to our globalizing age .
not surprisingly , Chinese leadership was keen to avoid any reference to the last two centuries of struggle and humiliation , or to its problematic political agendas and thorny trade issues .
at the same time , it could be argued that the spectacle of the opening ceremony was intended to overcome China ’ s historic humiliation by the West and signal a new chapter . the “ sleeping dragon , ” as Napoleon described China in the early nineteenth century , was now fully awake , ready to charge into the new world .
as in the Tang Dynasty , arts and culture were at center stage , reflecting the country ’ s economic prowess and political might .
but the extravaganza also left lingering doubts .
why such a drive to prove to the world that these had to be the very best Olympics ever ?
( Chinese authorities even pressed the International Olympic Committee to make such a declaration at the conclusion of the games . )
some have suggested that the effort suggests a hint of insecurity .
it should also be noted that while Mao was conspicuously absent in the Olympics , his communist legacy was present in subtle ways .
the relentless emphasis on the “ harmonious ” presence of large groups of performers left no room for individual voices ( even the young singer Lin Miaoke , as we now know , didn ’ t have her own voice ) .
ironically , while younger Chinese ( products of China ’ s one-child policy ) are obsessed with personal stylistic statements , the drama of the opening ceremony consisted in collective expression at the service of the state .
Chinese intellectuals have always been cognizant of this tension between individual creativity and collective will .
how will the new China balance these two conflicting needs ?
as we contemplate the potential arrival of the new Tang Dynasty in China , we should remember the message of the old Tang Dynasty poet , Po Chü-i ( 772-846 AD ) :
sent as a present from Annam ,
a red cockatoo .
Colored like the peach-tree blossom ,
speaking with the speech of men .
and they did to it what is always done
to the learned and eloquent .
they took a cage with stout bars
and shut it up inside .
Mexico CITY – For the next American president , fixing the international mess inherited from the Bush administration will be no simple task .
while Latin America will not be a priority for either an Obama or McCain administration , continuing the United States ’ neglect of the last seven years is no longer viable .
two distinct political / diplomatic challenges stand out : Cuba ’ s imminent transition or succession crisis , and the continuing ascent of the region ’ s “ two lefts , ” one represented by Venezuela ’ s President Hugo Chávez and the other by Brazil ’ s increasingly influential President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva .
the next US administration will only prove successful if it grasps that Latin America is living through a moment that combines the best and worst aspects of its history : the fastest economic growth since the 1970 ’ s , with poverty and inequality diminishing , and more democratic and respectful of human rights than ever before , but becoming more politically polarized .
in Cuba , Fidel Castro ’ s eventual passing from the scene represents an immense challenge .
the US cannot continue with the failed policies of the past half-century .
demanding a full-fledged democratic transition as a pre-condition for normalizing US-Cuban relations is both unrealistic and unpalatable to Latin America .
yet the US cannot set aside the question of democracy and human rights in Cuba while it awaits the departure of Fidel ’ s brother , Raúl .
realpolitik and fear of another exodus of Cuban refugees across the Florida Straits may tempt the US to pursue a “ Chinese ” or “ Vietnamese ” solution to Cuba : normalizing diplomatic relations in exchange for economic reform , while leaving the question of internal political change until later .
but the US should not succumb to this temptation .
the US , Canada , Europe , and Latin America have constructed a regional legal framework , which must not be abandoned , to defend democratic rule and human rights in the hemisphere .
Cuba needs to return to the regional concert of powers , but it must accept this concert ’ s rules .
holding free and fair elections may not be the primary issue , but nor are they issues that should be shelved in the interests of stability and expediency .
elections must instead be part of a comprehensive process of normalization : they should neither be a deal-breaker nor a non-issue .
while the US should lift its trade embargo as soon as Cuba ’ s transition begins , everything else should be conditional on Cuba initiating a process of resolving all outstanding issues .
but Cuba is just part of what might be called Latin America ’ s “ left ” problem .
indeed , much has been written recently about the ascent of the left in Latin America over the past decade .
in fact , there are two lefts in the region : a modern , democratic , globalized and market-friendly left , found in Chile , Brazil , Uruguay , parts of Central America , and , up to a point , in Peru ; and a retrograde , populist , authoritarian , statist , and anti-American left , found in Mexico , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Cuba , Ecuador , Bolivia , Venezuela , and , to a lesser extent , in Argentina , Colombia , and Paraguay .
some of these “ lefts ” are in power ; some , as in Mexico in its last , disputed presidential election , barely missed conquering it , but may still do so .
over the past two years , it has become increasingly evident that the “ modern ” or “ soft ” left is , all in all , governing well .
the other left has proved to be more extreme and erratic than many anticipated .
the former feels no urge to “ export ” its “ model , ” whereas the latter has a strategy and the means to do so .
the retrograde left today can realize Che Guevara ’ s old dream : not “ one , two , many Vietnams , ” but “ one , two , many Venezuelas , ” winning power by the ballot and then conserving and concentrating it through constitutional changes and the creation of armed militias and monolithic parties .
it can finance all of this with the support of Venezuela ’ s state oil company , implementing social policies that are misguided over the long term but seductive in the short run , especially when carried out by Cuban doctors , teachers , and instructors .
Herein lies a dilemma for the next US president : how to address the clear rift between the two lefts in a way that improves US-Latin American relations , fortifies the modern left , and weakens the retrograde left without resorting to the failed interventionist policies of the past .
the best , strictly Latin America-focused steps , are self-evident , if not easily achievable .
they require strengthening those governments of the modern left , or those of the center or center-right threatened by the old-fashioned left , and simultaneously making it clear to the latter that there is a price to be paid for violating the basic tenets of democracy , respect for human rights , and the rule of law .
turning its back in the face of such challenges is no longer a viable American option .
aside from areas of particular concern ( oil , arms , guerrillas , drugs ) , the US needs Latin America dearly nowadays because resistance to it is springing up everywhere , and with greater virulence than at any time since World War II ’ s end .
the next US president must reinvigorate a relationship that is ready to be substantially transformed for the first time since Franklin Roosevelt ’ s Good Neighbor Policy of seven decades ago .
Prague : Rebellion by Czech TV journalists against a new director of the publicly-owned Czech TV marks the climax of a ten year battle between two concepts of democracy .
the first concept is represented by former prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , the second by President Vaclav Havel .
Klaus sees political parties as the backbone of any democratic system and sees little place for civil society in politics .
he deems the proponents of civil society “ elitists ” who refuse to be tested at the ballot box and who try to influence politics through informal mechanisms .
President Havel argues that a democracy based only on political parties and basic democratic mechanisms is deformed .
in his view , political parties , although necessary , must be checked by a robust civil society .
if civil society is too weak , parties will seek to dominate institutions that should remain independent .
over the past ten years President Havel has repeatedly asked the Czechs to be more active and to not let politicians control their lives .
Klaus ’ s vision of democracy had the upper hand for most of the past decade .
easily understood , it conformed to patterns of behavior most Czechs acquired during the communist era , when public and private spheres of life were rigidly separated .
true , communism ’ s fall was brought about by a strong civic movement called “ Civic Forum ” , but that movement disintegrated once it achieved its goal .
with its passing , people became passive once more .
Klaus and his followers spearheaded the creation of well-functioning , standard political parties .
but in the absence of a strong civil society , those parties monopolized public space , pushing civic activists to the sidelines .
Havel was the first important Czech politician to criticize this trend , warning against excessive partisanship and arguing that political parties would become internally weak but outwardly authoritarian if they did not draw inspiration from a vibrant civil society .
unfortunately , Havel ’ s vision of democracy appears complicated when compared to that of Klaus .
in the past , calls for active civic engagement and Havel ’ s moralistic views left average Czechs cold and alienated political opponents , who accused him of promoting a nonpolitical form of politics .
prompted by civic passivity , political parties not only came to dominate every aspect of Czech life but engaged in dubious practices that increased cynicism and public passivity .
at the end of 1997 , the second Klaus government collapsed under the weight of financial scandals .
rather than learn from this fiasco , Klaus went on the offensive , claiming that he was a victim of a conspiracy hatched by Havel .
but his party , the Civic Democrats ( ODS ) , lost the June 1998 elections to the Social Democrats ( CSSD ) , whom Klaus vilified before the elections as a threat to democracy .
soon afterwards , however , the Civic Democrats and the Social Democrats signed the so-called “ opposition agreement ” , under which Klaus ’ s party gained important posts and other advantages in exchange for allowing the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Zeman to form a minority government .
Klaus , Zeman and their parties also agreed to work together to limit presidential power and the independence of the Central Bank by changing the Constitution , as well as to change the electoral law in their favor .
four smaller parties , who allied themselves in a four-party coalition called “ 4K ” objected .
protests against these political arrangements were criticized by the ODS and CSSD as attempts to undermine their efforts to ensure political stability .
despite the fact that the opposition agreement boosted the popularity of the unreformed Czech Communists , the determination of the Civic Democrats and Social Democrats to continue dividing the spoils of power remained undiminished .
in the fall of 2000 , Czech voters rebuked both parties during regional and Senate elections , with the Social Democrats losing their joint majority in the Senate .
because the Czech Parliament ’ s upper house has an absolute veto over constitutional amendments , the opportunity to amend the Constitution was lost .
loss of control of the Senate also meant that Klaus ’ s hope to replace Havel as president diminished .
defeat prompted Klaus and Zeman to try to and gain control over Czech TV by packing its council of overseers with their sympathizers .
shortly before Christmas , Czech TV ’ s director , who was resisting political pressure , was replaced by Jiri Hodac , a man with close ties to ODS .
TV journalists rebelled , occupying the station &apos;s newsroom .
the protests by artists , intellectuals and opposition politicians that followed were the biggest political upheavals since 1989 .
realizing that the game was lost , the Social Democrats joined with Klaus ’ s opponents in parliament on January 5th to demand Hodac ’ s resignation .
Parliament is also working on a new TV law to prevent political parties from politicizing the TV Council .
but political realignment is not the most important news arising from this turmoil .
of far greater importance is the reawakening of civil society which has , for the first time since 1989 , stood up to the political parties to reclaim the public space it relinquished ten years ago .
equally important is the fact that for the first time since 1989 , civil society has found a voice independent of President Havel .
unrecognized by almost everyone , Czech society has moved beyond Havel and Klaus .
it rejects Klaus ’ s truncated democracy , and , although it supports ( to some extent ) Havel ’ s vision , Havel himself is no longer the motor of civil society in action .
new YORK – Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism , the world is facing another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization : international capitalism and state capitalism .
the former , represented by the United States , has broken down , and the latter , represented by China , is on the rise .
following the path of least resistance will lead to the gradual disintegration of the international financial system .
a new multilateral system based on sounder principles must be invented .
while international cooperation on regulatory reform is difficult to achieve on a piecemeal basis , it may be attainable in a grand bargain that rearranges the entire financial order .
a new Bretton Woods conference , like the one that established the post-WWII international financial architecture , is needed to establish new international rules , including treatment of financial institutions that are too big to fail and the role of capital controls .
it would also have to reconstitute the International Monetary Fund to reflect better the prevailing pecking order among states and to revise its methods of operation .
in addition , a new Bretton Woods would have to reform the currency system .
the post-war order , which made the US more equal than others , produced dangerous imbalances .
the dollar no longer enjoys the trust and confidence that it once did , yet no other currency can take its place .
the US ought not to shy away from wider use of IMF Special Drawing Rights .
because SDRs are denominated in several national currencies , no single currency would enjoy an unfair advantage .
the range of currencies included in the SDRs would have to be widened , and some of the newly added currencies , including the renminbi , may not be fully convertible . this would , however , allow the international community to press China to abandon its exchange-rate peg to the dollar and would be the best way to reduce international imbalances .
and the dollar could still remain the preferred reserve currency , provided it is prudently managed .
one great advantage of SDRs is that they permit the international creation of money , which is particularly useful at times like the present .
the money could be directed to where it is most needed , unlike what is happening currently .
a mechanism that allows rich countries that don ’ t need additional reserves to transfer their allocations to those that do is readily available , using the IMF ’ s gold reserves .
Reorganizing the world order will need to extend beyond the financial system and involve the United Nations , especially membership of the Security Council .
that process needs to be initiated by the US , but China and other developing countries ought to participate as equals .
they are reluctant members of the Bretton Woods institutions , which are dominated by countries that are no longer dominant .
the rising powers must be present at the creation of this new system in order to ensure that they will be active supporters .
the system cannot survive in its present form , and the US has more to lose by not being in the forefront of reforming it .
the US is still in a position to lead the world , but , without far-sighted leadership , its relative position is likely to continue to erode .
it can no longer impose its will on others , as George W. Bush ’ s administration sought to do , but it could lead a cooperative effort to involve both the developed and the developing world , thereby reestablishing American leadership in an acceptable form .
the alternative is frightening , because a declining superpower losing both political and economic dominance but still preserving military supremacy is a dangerous mix .
we used to be reassured by the generalization that democratic countries seek peace .
after the Bush presidency , that rule no longer holds , if it ever did .
in fact , democracy is in deep trouble in America .
the financial crisis has inflicted hardship on a population that does not like to face harsh reality .
President Barack Obama has deployed the “ confidence multiplier ” and claims to have contained the recession .
but if there is a “ double dip ” recession , Americans will become susceptible to all kinds of fear mongering and populist demagogy .
if Obama fails , the next administration will be sorely tempted to create some diversion from troubles at home – at great peril to the world .
Obama has the right vision .
he believes in international cooperation , rather than the might-is-right philosophy of the Bush-Cheney era .
the emergence of the G-20 as the primary forum of international cooperation and the peer-review process agreed in Pittsburghare steps in the right direction .
what is lacking , however , is a general recognition that the system is broken and needs to be reinvented .
after all , the financial system did not collapse altogether , and the Obama administration made a conscious decision to revive banks with hidden subsidies rather than to recapitalize them on a compulsory basis .
those institutions that survived will hold a stronger market position than ever , and they will resist a systematic overhaul .
Obama is preoccupied by many pressing problems , and reinventing the international financial system is unlikely to receive his full attention .
China ’ s leadership needs to be even more far-sighted than Obama is .
China is replacing the American consumer as the motor of the world economy . since it is a smaller motor , the world economy will grow slower , but China ’ s influence will rise very fast .
for the time being , the Chinese public is willing to subordinate its individual freedom to political stability and economic advancement .
but that may not continue indefinitely – and the rest of the world will never subordinate its freedom to the prosperity of the Chinese state .
as China becomes a world leader , it must transform itself into a more open society that the rest of the world is willing to accept as a world leader . military power relations being what they are , China has no alternative to peaceful , harmonious development . indeed , the future of the world depends on it .

it is time for New Year &apos;s resolutions , and this year &apos;s are obvious .
when the millennium opened , world leaders pledged to seek peace , the end of poverty , and a cleaner environment .
since then , the world has seen countless acts of violence , terrorism , famine , and environmental degradation .
in 2005 , we can begin to change direction .
knowledge , scientific advance , travel , and global communications give us many opportunities to find solutions for the world &apos;s great problems .
when a new disease called SARS hit China last year , the World Health Organization coordinated the actions of dozens of governments , and the crisis was quickly brought under control , at least for now .
when Bill Gates donated $ 1 billion to bring vaccines to poor children , he made it possible to protect tens of millions of young people from preventable diseases .
when an agricultural research unit called the World Agroforestry Center discovered that a certain tree could help African farmers grow more food , they introduced a new and valuable approach to overcoming Africa &apos;s chronic food crisis .
unfortunately , such examples of international cooperation are as rare as they are impressive .
with our knowledge , science , and technology , the horrendous living conditions of the world &apos;s poorest people could be dramatically improved .
millions of people could be spared malaria , HIV / AIDS , hunger , and life in slums .
the problem is not that we lack good solutions .
the problem is that we fail to cooperate globally to put those solutions into practice .
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has honored me by making me his Special Adviser on the Millennium Development Goals and asking me to lead a group of scholars and development experts in identifying practical steps to reach the goals by the target date in 2015 .
this effort , known as the UN Millennium Project , will issue its report to Secretary-General Annan on January 17 , 2005 .
our study , Investing in Development : a Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals , will be available for free around the world at www.unmillenniumproject.org .
what we learned is easily summarized .
for every major problem - hunger , illiteracy , malnutrition , malaria , AIDS , drought , and so forth - there are practical solutions that are proven and affordable .
these investments , in turn , would strengthen the private sector and economic growth .
yet they require global partnership between the rich and poor countries of the world .
most importantly , the world &apos;s richest countries need to do much more to help the poorest countries make use of modern science and technology to solve these great problems .
the US , for example , currently spends around $ 450 billion each year on its military , but less than $ 15 billion to help the world &apos;s poorest countries fight disease , educate their children , and protect the environment .
this is a mistake , because military approaches alone cannot make America safe .
only shared prosperity can truly make the planet secure .
the US should be investing much more in peaceful economic development .
Germany , Japan , and several other rich countries are also doing much less than they should - and much less than they promised the poor countries that they would do .
in 2002 , all donor countries committed to &quot; make concrete efforts &quot; to reach 0.7 % of national income in development aid to poor countries .
Germany , Japan , and the US , among others , remain far below this commitment .
the year 2005 will offer many opportunities for citizens around the world to insist that their leaders keep their Millennium promises .
after our report is issued in January , Secretary-General Kofi Annan will issue a report to the world in the spring , identifying the practical steps that should be taken this year .
around the same time , an important commission on Africa will issue a report to United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair .
then , in July , the UK will host the annual G-8 Summit of the rich countries .
Blair has promised that he will make the fight against poverty and long-term climate change the two priorities of the summit .
in September , the world &apos;s leaders will reconvene at the UN to decide on their actions during the coming decade .
the rich and powerful nations often declare their leadership in the world .
the US claims that it helps the world fight poverty , but instead spends its money on weapons .
Germany and Japan say that they want a permanent seat on the UN Security Council , but neither has yet followed through on its own pledges to help the world &apos;s poorest people .
the world &apos;s poorest countries will ask themselves why they should vote for Germany and Japan to have permanent seats on the Security Council if they can &apos;t keep their promises .
nothing would be wiser for the world &apos;s rich countries than to fulfill their pledges to the world &apos;s poor , hungry and disease-ridden peoples .
Therein lies the path to sustained peace .
2005 is the year that words can become reality , and that the world can begin to fulfill its hopes for our new millennium .
let us make our leaders aware that we aspire to shared peace and prosperity .
let us pledge that the rich and powerful should take real actions to help the poor , the weak , and the suffering .
London : a hundred years ago , the humorous English magazine Punch carried a cartoon which depicted a young and nervous curate eating breakfast with his bishop .
he was eating a boiled egg , and clearly not enjoying it .
the bishop enquired : “ I say - is your egg all right ? ” And the curate replies : “ My Lord , it is excellent in parts . ”
the cartoon caught the English fancy , and created a catch-phrase still in use today , although it is usually misunderstood and misused .
someone may say : “ It ’ s a bit of a curate ’ s egg ” , when he means that something is a mixture of good and bad .
but of course the point of the original joke was that the curate was just being polite : an egg is either good or bad , and his was bad .
this week ’ s European Summit at Nice ( December 7-9 ) looks like being a curate ’ s egg .
the question is , will it be bad all through and a failure ?
or will it be “ excellent in parts ” ?
the probable answer is : both .
it will almost certainly fail to achieve its immediate objectives ; but it may open the door to serious progress afterwards .
the ostensible purpose of the summit is to make those changes in the European Union ’ s decision-making machinery that would enable it to cope with the admission of at least 12 new members , mainly from Central and Eastern Europe .
everyone knows that these changes ought to be radical , even semi-federal .
at the very least , the coming enlargement will call for much more majority voting in the Council of Ministers , if the Union is not be paralyzed by 27 member states and 27 national vetoes .
but most member states are unwilling to contemplate anything that far-reaching .
the host French , who currently hold the EU Presidency , have listed 50 policy areas where majority voting might be possible .
every country , however , has special sensitivities : the Germans are unwilling to be outvoted on immigration ; the French are unwilling to be outvoted on trade in services ; the British are unwilling to be outvoted on taxation .
the cumulative result of all these national objections , is that the Nice summit is likely to see only a modest increase in the potential for majority voting , much smaller than enlargement requires .
a similar reluctance will dominate the rest of the immediate institutional agenda .
in principle , the Commission ought to be slimmed down after enlargement , with fewer Commissioners than member states .
equally , big member states ought to have more votes in the Council of Ministers , to reflect their greater populations .
small member states do not like either proposition , because they would lose Commissioners and votes .
on both issues , expect a serious tug-of-war , and any decisions are likely to be half-hearted , or in practice postponed .
yet , the 15 member states may compensate for their collective failure of nerve by opening up easier options for flexible or multi-speed integration .
this might be a way round the majority voting dilemma , since it would allow groups of member states to cooperate together in particular areas , without waiting for the unanimous agreement of all partners .
whether this would really be a desirable procedure is hotly debated ; but the fact is that multi-speed integration already exists in the sense that Britain and Denmark are not now , and may never be , members of the euro .
if these scraps were to be the sum total of the Nice summit , it will prove unsatisfactory , even a failure .
but the real significance of the meeting may turn out to be , not the limited decisions which the heads of government are able and willing to take this time round , but the opening up , virtually for the first time , of serious discussion about the future direction of the European Union .
one thing that will happen at Nice will be the formal adoption of a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
in its present form , this document recapitulates all kinds of rights which EU citizens already enjoy under existing laws ; it is not intended to confer any new rights , and it cannot be enforced in the European Court of Justice .
in other words , it is a public relations conjuring trick , designed to make the EU seem more attractive , without actually conferring any real benefits .
even as a conjuring trick , the Charter could be influential .
for example , Article 2 reads : “ Everyone has the right to life .
no one shall be condemned to the death penalty , or executed . ” It seems evident that this principle will be effectively binding on all member states , and all candidates for membership .
the question at Nice will be whether the Charter should be incorporated into the EU Treaties , and thus given the force of law .
another similar question at Nice will be whether the time has come to simplify the EU Treaties , which are now a confusing jumble of general principles and difficult detail .
simplification might be intended , at the start , as another conjuring trick : to make the Treaties more comprehensible to voters without changing anything in law .
but it could also become the first , essential step on the road to the drafting of a European constitution .
Washington , DC – Leaders around the world are vigorously debating the advisability of establishing a no-fly zone to stop the violence unfolding in Libya .
some cite Bosnia , where NATO took too long to protect civilian populations in the mid-1990 ’ s , as a reason to act .
others remember Rwanda , where President Bill Clinton later expressed regret for not acting to save innocent lives .
but the stakes in Libya today are more appropriately underscored by the tragedy in southern Iraq in the waning days of the Persian Gulf War 20 years ago .
as coalition forces were routing the Iraqi army in February 1991 , President George H.W. Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to “ take matters into their hands to force Saddam Hussein the dictator to step aside . ”
when Iraqi Shiites , Kurds , and Marsh Arabs rebelled against Hussein , they believed that American forces would protect them against their brutal dictator ’ s superior firepower .
instead , when Iraqi attack helicopters and elite troops began butchering their own people , coalition forces were ordered to stand down .
the world watched as thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered .
the situation in Libya today is not identical .
inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt , the Libyan people rose up spontaneously against four decades of repression by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi .
still , the specter that haunts me is the same – ordinary people facing off against an autocrat ’ s airpower and well-armed soldiers , counting on the free world to protect them against massacre after we have applauded and bolstered their bravery with our words .
so far , Qaddafi ’ s forces have relied on airpower selectively .
but Qaddafi is shrewd .
my fear is that he is either choosing to bleed the opposition to death , rather than invite global action with a broad massacre , or waiting for the world to prove itself unwilling to act – at which point he might well begin killing civilians in large numbers .
we cannot wait for that to happen .
we need to take concrete steps now so that we are prepared to implement a no-fly zone immediately if Qaddafi starts using his airpower to kill large numbers of civilians .
diplomacy is urgently needed to build broad support for a no-fly zone .
the most important imprimatur should come from the United Nations , where debate should begin immediately over a resolution authorizing a no-fly zone .
China and Russia have expressed reservations .
if the Security Council fails to authorize action , those of us determined to protect Libyan civilians will face a more difficult choice should the violence escalate .
so our diplomatic efforts must extend beyond the UN .
the support of NATO and the African Union are important .
to avoid the perception of NATO or the US attacking another Muslim country , the backing of the Arab world is also needed .
on that front , there are promising signs .
the six Arab countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have called for a UN-imposed no-fly zone .
the Arab League has endorsed a similar proposal .
Muslim countries in particular should support preparations for intervention if the violence spirals out of control .
Qaddafi cannot be allowed to think that he can massacre his people with impunity . and he cannot be free to make those attacks more lethal by using his airpower .
if the UN cannot approve a resolution for implementing a no-fly zone , then the US and its allies in NATO and the Arab world must be prepared to prevent a massacre like the one that occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 , when more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were slaughtered .
of course , imposing a no-fly zone would not be a panacea .
it probably would not tip the balance if the situation in Libya deteriorates into a full-scale civil war .
but a no-fly zone would eliminate airstrikes and save civilian lives .
it is a tool that we should be ready to use if the situation warrants it , and it would signal to the opposition that it is not alone .
before that decision is reached , the international community needs to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies to the rebels in eastern Libya .
we must not allow them to be starved into submission .
the one option that should not be on the table is US ground troops ; no one wants to see US forces bogged down in another war , especially in another Muslim country .
and , as President Barack Obama has said , the Libyan people must not be deprived of full ownership of their struggle for freedom , and Qaddafi must not be given a useful foil and scapegoat .
perhaps the mere threat of a no-fly zone will keep Qaddafi ’ s pilots from using their helicopters and fighter jets to kill their own people .
if it does not , we should make clear that we will lead the free world to avoid the senseless slaughter of any more Libyan citizens by a madman bent on maintaining power .
the US and the world community should also make clear – as we did in Bosnia and Kosovo – that we are taking a united stand against a thug who is killing Muslims .
London – Earlier this week , a group of almost 100 prominent Europeans delivered an open letter to the leaders of all 17 eurozone countries .
the letter said , in so many words , what the leaders of Europe now appear to have understood : they cannot go on “ kicking the can down the road . ”
and , just as importantly , they now understand that it is not enough to ensure that governments can finance their debt at reasonable interest rates ; they must also address the weakness of Europe ’ s banking system .
indeed , Europe ’ s banking and sovereign-debt problems are mutually self-reinforcing .
the decline in government bond prices has exposed the banks ’ undercapitalization , while the prospect that governments will have to finance banks ’ recapitalization has driven up risk premiums on government bonds .
facing the prospect of having to raise additional capital at a time when their shares are selling at a fraction of book value , banks have a powerful incentive to reduce their balance sheets by withdrawing credit lines and shrinking their loan portfolios .
Europe ’ s leaders are now contemplating what to do , and their next move will have fateful consequences , either calming the markets or driving them to new extremes .
all agree that Greece needs an orderly restructuring , because a disorderly default could cause a eurozone meltdown .
but , when it comes to the banks , I am afraid that the eurozone ’ s leaders are contemplating some inappropriate steps .
specifically , they are talking about recapitalizing the banking system , rather than guaranteeing it .
and they want to do it on a country-by-country basis , rather than on the basis of the eurozone as a whole .
there is a good reason for this : Germany does not want to pay for recapitalizing French banks .
but , while Chancellor Angela Merkel is justified in insisting on this , it is driving her in the wrong direction .
let me stake out more precisely the narrow path that would allow Europe to pass through this minefield .
the banking system needs to be guaranteed first , and recapitalized later .
governments cannot afford to recapitalize the banks now ; it would leave them with insufficient funds to deal with the sovereign-debt problem .
it will cost much less to recapitalize the banks after the crisis has abated and both government bonds and bank shares have returned to more normal levels .
governments can , however , provide a credible guarantee , given their power to tax .
a new , legally binding agreement – not a change to the Lisbon Treaty ( which would encounter too many hurdles ) , but a new agreement – will be needed for the eurozone to mobilize that power , and such an accord will take time to negotiate and ratify . but , in the meantime , governments can call upon the European Central Bank , which the eurozone member states already fully guarantee on a pro rata basis .
in exchange for a guarantee , the eurozone ’ s major banks would have to agree to abide by the ECB ’ s instructions .
this is a radical step , but a necessary one under the circumstances .
acting at the behest of the member states , the ECB has sufficient powers of persuasion : it could close its discount window to the banks , and the governments could seize institutions that refuse to cooperate .
the ECB would then instruct the banks to maintain their credit lines and loan portfolios while strictly monitoring the risks they take for their own account .
this would remove one of the two main driving forces of the current market turmoil .
the ECB could deal with the other driving force , the lack of financing for sovereign debt , by lowering its discount rate , encouraging distressed governments to issue treasury bills , and encouraging the banks to subscribe ( an idea I owe to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa ) .
the T-bills could be sold to the ECB at any time , making them tantamount to cash ; but , as long as they yield more than deposits with the ECB , the banks would find it advantageous to hold them .
governments could meet their financing needs within agreed limits at very low cost during this emergency period , and the ECB would not violate Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty .
these measures would be sufficient to calm markets and bring the acute phase of the crisis to an end .
recapitalization of the banks should wait until then ; only the holes created by restructuring the Greek debt would have to be filled immediately .
in conformity with Germany ’ s demand , the additional capital would come first from the market and then from individual governments – and from the European Financial Stability Facility only as a last resort , thereby preserving the EFSF ’ s firepower .
a new agreement for the eurozone , negotiated in a calmer atmosphere , should not only codify the practices established during the emergency , but also lay the groundwork for an economic-growth strategy .
during the emergency period , fiscal retrenchment and austerity are unavoidable ; but , in the longer term , the debt burden will become unsustainable without growth – and so will the European Union itself .
Prague – The global financial crisis may be grabbing all the headlines , but resolving it should not be allowed to crowd out other vital issues .
in the Middle East , for example , Israelis and Palestinians – as well as many others around the world – are beginning to believe that the permanent status negotiations to determine the future of Palestine are going nowhere .
the situation may be more promising than it appears , but one cannot deny that hope for real changes on the ground has faded since talks were re-launched two years ago .
this loss of faith is , sadly , establishing a dynamic that will itself inhibit the concessions that are needed if a permanent agreement is to be found .
because an impasse beckons , it is vitally important to work on those areas where intensive negotiations have the potential to produce quick results .
fresh water is one such area .
across the Middle East , water is a security issue .
indeed , people are now recognizing two important facts .
first , nations faced with conflicting claims to water have historically found ways to collaborate rather than to fight .
even during the 60 years of conflict in the Jordan Valley , water has more often been a source of cooperation than of conflict .
second , water scarcity is seldom absolute , and even less often an explanation of poverty .
to quote the United Nations Human Development Report for 2006 : “ There is more than enough water in the world for domestic purposes , for agriculture and for industry … .Scarcity is manufactured through political processes and institutions that disadvantage the poor . ”
but almost every nation in the Middle East is using more water than arrives on a renewable basis .
there simply is not enough water for everything these nations want to use it for , and the situation will only worsen .
yet , even in Palestine , the key water issue is not thirst , but arrested economic development .
in the short term , Palestine needs more water to provide employment and income from farming ; in the longer term , educational , cultural , and political changes are needed in order to develop a capacity to adapt .
the region ’ s climate and geography mean that water resources are unavoidably shared .
but only if water is shared in a rational manner that respects the region ’ s fragile ecology will human life be sustainable .
clearly , no final agreement on water will be possible until there are agreed-upon borders between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine , and some resolution of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank .
but interim resolution of water issues does not need to wait for final resolution of the major issues .
finding rational ways to share and co-manage water may be easier than solving the “ big ” issues .
in fact , water could help to create a climate of success that aids progress in other areas .
the good news is that the quantity of water that is needed for drinking , cooking , other household chores and sanitation is small .
most water is used to grow food , so , if a nation ’ s economy is healthy , there is scope for saving water by importing a greater share of food , although every nation will want to maintain some assured food supply for security reasons .
the bad news is that water , unlike land , cannot simply be divided .
water flows on the surface and underground .
as it moves , it changes in quantity and quality , and it supports different ecosystems .
Moreover , demand for water changes over time .
only a few percentage points of the Israeli GNP come from agriculture today ; as a result , its economy requires less water than it once did .
exactly the same transition is likely to occur in Palestine , but it has not happened yet .
few Israelis deny that Palestinians need more water .
similarly , there is wide agreement that some water currently used by Israelis will have to be allocated to Palestinian use .
the current negotiations will inevitably deal with rights to water , which do not seem to be very contentious anymore , and the talks can suggest various mechanisms for transfer of management in some cases and for shared management in others .
these are eminently negotiable issues .
a flexible and sustainable formula can certainly be found , almost surely including a transitional period that allows both sides to adjust to and account for their different water management systems , as well as for changing conditions and institutions in the future .
the principle of a just division of water resources to meet the Palestinians ’ urgent needs for additional water should be taken as a starting point .
everything else can be worked out .
shared water calls for flexible , continuous , cooperative water management , based on agreed-upon rights and responsibilities , as well as ongoing monitoring and dispute resolution mechanisms .
one important point should be added : extensive public participation and transparency , in terms of both process and outcomes , will be key to successful management .
we believe that progress in the peace process and in finding solutions for water issues between Israel and Palestine would also help to unblock progress in the broader region , between the parties on the Jordan , the Orontes , the Tigris , and the Euphrates rivers .
water can be a catalyst for regional cooperation , opening the way to a future comprehensive “ Community of Water and Energy ” to enhance the human environment .
in such a forum , water and solar energy in tandem could help to move the Middle East from conflict to collaboration .
the cost of inaction or merely pretending to act is likely to be high for everyone in the Middle East .
future water policy should no longer be seen as an extension of current policy , but rather as a new opportunity .
water is the essence of life .
people in Palestine and in Israel need it ; people in the region need it .
cooperating to secure it is the only way forward .
new HAVEN – We are in the midst of a boom in popular economics : books , articles , blogs , public lectures , all followed closely by the general public .
I recently participated in a panel discussion of this phenomenon at the American Economic Association annual meeting in Denver .
an apparent paradox emerged from the discussion : the boom in popular economics comes at a time when the general public seems to have lost faith in professional economists , because almost all of us failed to predict , or even warn of , the current economic crisis , the biggest since the Great Depression .
so , why is the public buying more books by professional economists ?
the most interesting explanation I heard was that economics has become more interesting , because it no longer seems to be a finished and closed discipline .
it is no fun to read a book or article that says that economic forecasting is best left to computer models that you , the general reader , would need a Ph.D. to understand .
and , in truth , the public is right : while there is a somewhat scientific basis for these models , they can go spectacularly wrong .
sometimes we need to turn off autopilot and think for ourselves , and when a crisis occurs , use our best human intellect .
the panelists all said , in one way or another , that popular economics facilitates an exchange between specialized economists and the broader public – a dialogue that has never been more important .
after all , most economists did not see this crisis coming in part because they had removed themselves from what real-world people were doing and thinking .
successful popular economics involves the reader or listener , in some sense , as a collaborator .
that , of course , means that economists must be willing to include new and original theories that are not yet received doctrine among professional specialists .
until recently , many professional economists would be reluctant to write a popular book .
certainly , it would not be viewed favorably in considering a candidate for tenure or a promotion .
since it does not include equations or statistical tables , they would argue , it is not serious work that is worthy of scholarly attention .
worse than that , at least until recently , a committee evaluating an economist would likely think that writing a popular economics book that does not repeat the received wisdom of the discipline might even be professionally unethical .
imagine how the medical profession would view one of its members who recommended to the general public some therapy that had not yet passed scrutiny from the appropriate authorities .
medical professionals know how often seemingly promising new therapies turn out , after careful study , not to work , or even to be harmful .
there is a rigorous process of scholarly review of proposed new therapies , associated with professional journals that uphold high research standards .
Circumventing that process and promoting new , untested ideas to the general public is unprofessional .
in the decades prior to the current financial crisis , economists gradually came to view themselves and their profession in the same way , encouraged by research trends .
for example , after 1960 , when the University of Chicago started creating a Univac computer tape that contained systematic information about millions of stock prices , a great deal of scientific research on the properties of stock prices was taken as confirming the “ efficient markets hypothesis . ”
the competitive forces that underlie stock exchanges were seen to force all securities prices to their true fundamental values .
all trading schemes not based on this hypothesis were labeled as either misguided or outright frauds .
science had triumphed over stock-market punditry – or so it seemed .
the financial crisis delivered a fatal blow to that overconfidence in scientific economics .
it is not just that the profession didn ’ t forecast the crisis .
their models , taken literally , sometimes suggested that a crisis of this magnitude couldn ’ t happen .
one way to interpret this is that the economics profession was not fully accounting for the economy ’ s human element , an element that can ’ t be reduced to mathematical analysis .
the relatively few professional economists who warned of the current crisis were people , it seems , who not only read the scholarly economics literature , but also brought into play more personal judgment : intuitive comparisons with past historical episodes ; conclusions about speculative trading , price bubbles , and the stability of confidence ; evaluations of the moral purposes of economic actors ; and impressions that complacency had set in , lulling watchdogs to sleep .
these were judgments made by economists who were familiar with our business leadership – their inspirations , beliefs , subterfuges , and rationalizations .
their views could never be submitted to a scholarly journal and evaluated the way a new medical procedure is .
there is no established scientific procedure that could prove their validity .
of course , economics is in many ways a science , and the work of our scholars and their computer models really does matter .
but , as the economist Edwin R. A. Seligman put it in 1889 , “ Economics is a social science , i.e. , it is an ethical and therefore an historical science … .It is not a natural science , and therefore not an exact or purely abstract science . ”
to me , and no doubt to the other panelists , part of the process of pursuing the inexact aspects of economics is speaking honestly to the broader public , looking them in the eye , learning from them , reading the emails they send , and then searching one ’ s soul to decide whether one ’ s favored theory is really close to the truth .
new YORK – Where is the American and global economy headed ?
last year , there were two sides to the debate .
one camp argued that the recession in the United States would be V-shaped – short and shallow .
it would last only eight months , like the two previous recessions of 1990-1991 and 2001 , and the world would decouple from the US contraction .
others , including me , argued that , given the excesses of private-sector leverage ( in households , financial institutions , and corporate firms ) , this would be a U-shaped recession – long and deep .
it would last about 24 months , and the world would not decouple from the US contraction .
today , 20 months into the US recession – a recession that became global in the summer of 2008 with a massive re-coupling – the V-shaped decoupling view is out the window .
this is the worst US and global recession in 60 years .
if the US recession were – as most likely - to be over at the end of the year , as is likely , it will have been three times as long and about fives times as deep – in term of the cumulative decline in output – as the previous two .
today ’ s consensus among economists is that the recession is already over , that the US and global economy will rapidly return to growth , and that there is no risk of a relapse .
unfortunately , this new consensus could be as wrong now as the defenders of the V-shaped scenario were for the past three years .
data from the US – rising unemployment , falling household consumption , still declining industrial production , and a weak housing market – suggest that America ’ s recession is not over yet .
a similar analysis of many other advanced economies suggests that , as in the US , the bottom is quite close but it has not yet been reached .
most emerging economies may be returning to growth , but they are performing well below their potential .
Moreover , for a number of reasons , growth in the advanced economies is likely to remain anemic and well below trend for at least a couple of years .
the first reason is likely to create a long-term drag on growth : households need to deleverage and save more , which will constrain consumption for years .
second , the financial system – both banks and non-bank institutions – is severely damaged .
lack of robust credit growth will hamper private consumption and investment spending .
third , the corporate sector faces a glut of capacity , and a weak recovery of profitability is likely if growth is anemic and deflationary pressures still persist .
as a result , businesses are not likely to increase capital spending .
fourth , the re-leveraging of the public sector through large fiscal deficits and debt accumulation risks crowding out a recovery in private-sector spending .
the effects of the policy stimulus , moreover , will fizzle out by early next year , requiring greater private demand to support continued growth .
domestic private demand , especially consumption , is now weak or falling in over-spending countries ( the US , the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , Australia , New Zealand , etc . ) , while not increasing fast enough in over-saving countries ( China , Asia , Germany , Japan , etc . ) to compensate for the reduction in these countries ’ net exports .
thus , there is a global slackening of aggregate demand relative to the glut of supply capacity , which will impede a robust global economic recovery .
there are also now two reasons to fear a double-dip recession .
first , the exit strategy from monetary and fiscal easing could be botched , because policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don ’ t .
if they take their fiscal deficits ( and a potential monetization of these deficits ) seriously and raise taxes , reduce spending , and mop up excess liquidity , they could undermine the already weak recovery .
but if they maintain large budget deficits and continue to monetize them , at some point – after the current deflationary forces become more subdued – bond markets will revolt .
at this point , inflationary expectations will increase , long-term government bond yields will rise , and the recovery will be crowded out .
a second reason to fear a double-dip recession concerns the fact that oil , energy , and food prices may be rising faster than economic fundamentals warrant , and could be driven higher by the wall of liquidity chasing assets , as well as by speculative demand .
last year , oil at $ 145 a barrel was a tipping point for the global economy , as it created a major income shock for the US , Europe , Japan , China , India , and other oil-importing economies .
the global economy , barely rising from its knees , could not withstand the contractionary shock if similar speculative forces were to drive oil rapidly towards $ 100 a barrel .
so the end of this severe global recession will be closer at the end of this year than it is now , the recovery will be anemic rather than robust in advanced economies , and there is a rising risk of a double-dip recession .
the recent market rallies in stocks , commodities , and credit may have gotten ahead of the improvement in the real economy .
if so , a correction cannot be too far behind .
London – The Greek debt problem has been poorly handled by Europe ’ s decision-makers .
European Union heads of government , and the European Central Bank , initially rejected the idea of involving the International Monetary Fund , but without a fall-back plan . it is hard to avoid the conclusion that part of the motivation for this was French President Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s reluctance to see Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the IMF ’ s managing director , ride in from Washington to the rescue of the eurozone .
Strauss-Kahn is , of course , likely to be Sarkozy ’ s Socialist rival in the next French presidential election .
is Greece the “ canary in the coalmine ” – the warning that tells us that Europe ’ s monetary union is on the verge of dissolution , with the other three of the famous PIGS ( Portugal , Italy , and Spain ) lining up like dominoes to fall ? George Soros fears this might be the case , and gives the eurozone only a 50 % chance of survival in its present form .
certainly , the episode highlighted flaws in the way the euro ’ s governance – flaws that are no surprise to some of those involved in creating the common currency .
Helmut Kohl , one of the euro ’ s principal parents , said in 1991 that “ the idea of sustaining an economic and monetary union over time without political union is a fallacy . ” Margaret Thatcher , from the opposite camp , said in her memoirs : “ I believe the European single currency is bound to fail , economically , politically and indeed socially , although the timing , occasion and consequences are all still unclear . ”
there may now be a market for a Greek translation of her book .
although they might not agree with either of these two apocalyptic predictions , many of Europe ’ s leaders are coming round to the view that there is a need for change , and that the Greek case has revealed a flaw at the center of the project . Sarkozy , for example , has revived a long-standing French argument for some form of economic government in Europe as a counterweight to the ECB .
the French usually advance this proposal to get some purchase on the ECB ’ s monetary decisions , which they sometimes consider hostile to growth and employment , or in order to prevent other countries from maintaining unfair tax policies ( “ unfair ” usually being defined as a tax rate lower than the relevant French one ) .
in the past , the Germans brushed these arguments aside , but now they are a little more receptive . German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble , however , focuses on the issue of distressed members , and has advanced a proposal for a European Monetary Fund to provide assistance to countries in Greek-style difficulties , roughly on the IMF model .
this idea has logic behind it . the drawback is that it would require a change in the European treaties , which in turn requires a unanimous decision by 27 countries , and positive votes in referendums in some of them , including the United Kingdom if David Cameron ’ s Conservatives win the upcoming general election there .
in the aftermath of the negative referendum votes in France , the Netherlands , and Ireland on European constitutional reform , it is close to inconceivable that EU heads of government would agree to set off down that path again . certainly nothing could be achieved on a timetable that would offer any comfort to the other PIGS .
they would all be bacon and sausages before any agreement was reached .
so , in the short run , the IMF will have to be used , if that kind of support is needed , and Sarkozy will have to swallow his pride .
but is an EMF really what is required in the long run ?
I think not .
nor do I think that a European economic government is strictly necessary . what is needed , though , is a collective agreement on fiscal discipline , and a revival of the Stability and Growth Pact , which was unwisely abandoned – ironically when the French and Germans found its rules too constraining .
Europe ’ s leaders should refer to a paper by Otmar Issing , “ The Euro – A Currency Without a State , ” published in December 2008 , before the debt crisis erupted . Issing , the ECB ’ s chief economist in its formative years , knows more about how a monetary union operates in practice than any man alive .
he maintains that “ the Stability and Growth Pact contains all the rules that are necessary for Monetary Union to function .
there is no need for coordination of macroeconomic policies to go any further than this . ”
Europe does not need the French plan for coordination of tax policies , or another IMF , but there does need to be fiscal discipline to prevent other countries from free riding , as the Greeks seem to have done . they apparently assumed that the rest of Europe would overlook continuing high deficits , and that , as eurozone members , the market would consider their debt to be just like German bunds , though issued by friendly and welcoming people in an agreeable climate , and with a glass of ouzo on the side .
the original Pact envisaged a 3 % -of-GDP cap on fiscal deficits , save in exceptional circumstances .
investors well understand that we are in such circumstances now , so it will take some time to get back to that level . but that should be the clear aim , with IMF assistance along the way to provide interim funding where necessary and political cover for governments obliged to take tough decisions on public spending and taxation .
fiscal discipline does not sound as visionary as “ economic government . ”
but the EU has suffered from a surfeit of “ vision ” and a deficit of practical budgetary measures . it is time to redress that balance , or Soros ’ s gloomy prognosis may become reality .
PRINCETON – On February 1 , the United Nations Security Council met to consider the Arab League ’ s proposal to end the violence in Syria .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton represented the United States .
Midway through her remarks , she began speaking not to the Syrian ambassador , who was in the room , or even the Syrian government , but directly to the Syrian people .
she said that change in Syria would require Syrians of every faith and ethnicity to work together , protecting and respecting the rights of minorities .
addressing those minorities , she continued : “ We do hear your fears , and we do honor your aspirations . do not let the current regime exploit them to extend this crisis . ”
she told Syria ’ s business , military , and other leaders that they must recognize that their futures lie with the state , not with the regime . “ Syria belongs to its 23 million citizens , not to one man or his family . ”
speaking directly to citizens – seeing a country ’ s people , as well as its government – is not just a rhetorical device .
while many foreign-policy pundits have focused on the US “ pivot to Asia , ” Clinton has also executed a less-publicized , but no less important , pivot to the people .
she has introduced policies , programs , and institutional reforms designed to support government-to-society and society-to-society diplomacy , alongside traditional government-to-government relations .
these initiatives do not get headlines , but they will gradually transform much of American foreign policy .
in January , the State Department unveiled a new “ super-office ” of Civilian Security , Democracy , and Human Rights , under the leadership of Under-Secretary Maria Otero .
the office brings together agencies that focus on international law enforcement , counter-terrorism , and reconstruction and stabilization with those charged with advancing democracy , human rights , and humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants .
Otero explains the logic behind the initiative in terms of “ protecting individuals . ”
that , in turn , requires “ not just engaging state to state , ” but also working “ with players and actors outside of the traditional &#91; channels &#93; we ’ ve engaged in . ”
viewed from this perspective , countering terrorism includes rebutting terrorist propaganda with a strategic communications campaign .
countering narco-gang violence includes working with Mexican telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim to develop tools that allow ordinary citizens to report violence anonymously by text message and enable police to map the results .
strengthening democracy means working with the Kenyan developers of a crisis-mapping platform that allows anyone with a cell phone to text information about election fraud or violence to a central monitoring station .
on a country-by-country basis , pivoting to the people means engaging with Egypt ’ s bloggers as well as with the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ; convening young entrepreneurs in Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco and connecting them to funding and mentoring ; and using social media in Russia to rebut government efforts to smear the US ambassador .
and , working at an official level , it means co-sponsoring with Brazil the Open Government Partnership , which brings together governments committed to increasing transparency , accountability , and citizen participation , and uses mutual peer pressure and open reporting to hold them to their commitments .
thinking about countries in these comprehensive terms also provides a different strategic perspective .
Clinton has created a raft of new positions at the State Department to spur outreach to different social segments .
the strategies and programs developed by the Ambassador for Global Women ’ s Issues , the Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues , the Senior Adviser for Civil Society and Emerging Democracies , the Special Representative for Outreach to Muslim Communities , the Special Representative for Global Partnerships , and the Special Representative for Commercial and Business Affairs often present a very different face of the US .
as a result , Clinton has launched an actual strategic dialogue with civil society .
for example , Ambassador Melanne Verveer has attended more than 1,000 events around the world focused on empowering women in areas ranging from peace negotiations to farming .
similarly , she has launched programs such as mWomen , designed to expand and support mobile technology that increases women ’ s independence , security , and access to health care and vital knowledge .
the Office of Global Youth Affairs is building a local youth council at every US embassy around the world , to advise and help to implement embassy programming aimed at local youth .
much of the programming aimed at youth , women , entrepreneurs , diasporas , technologists , and other social groups is partly funded and conducted by the private sector .
indeed , the Obama administration ’ s National Security Strategy mentions “ public-private partnerships ” more than 30 times .
Clinton created the Global Partnership Initiative to build as many coalitions , networks , and partnerships as possible with corporations , foundations , NGOs , universities , and other civic organizations .
here , the pivot to the people includes the American people : the dynamism , creativity , and resources of American business and non-profit organizations already engaged around the world .
one privately-funded initiative spearheaded by the State Department will send 300 dogwood trees to Japan this spring , to be planted in the tsunami-affected region and in Tokyo to express the American people ’ s support for the Japanese people ; another will send English teachers throughout Southeast Asia .
after participating in the Friends of Syria conference in Tunis , Clinton convened a town hall meeting with Tunisian youth .
in her opening remarks , she told her audience that “ young people are at the heart of today ’ s great strategic opportunities and challenges . ”
speaking about her lifetime efforts to put “ women ’ s empowerment on the international agenda , ” she added , “ It ’ s time to put youth empowerment there as well . ”
the implications of all of this activity , which Clinton calls “ twenty-first-century statecraft , ” are profound .
from now on , US diplomatic relations with other countries will engage directly with their people and connect them to the American people as much as possible .
from the perspective of US diplomats , the people of every country stand on the same footing as their government .
that assumption is the heart of democracy ; it is a revolution for diplomacy .
MELBOURNE – Two new movies released this month – one a science-fiction blockbuster , the other a revealing documentary – raise the issue of our relations with our closest non-human relatives , the great apes .
both dramatize insights and lessons that should not be ignored .
Rupert Wyatt ’ s Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the seventh film in a series based on Pierre Boule ’ s 1963 novel , Planet of the Apes , about a world populated by highly intelligent simians .
Publicity for the new film claims that it is “ the first live-action film in the history of movies to star , and be told from the point of view of , a sentient animal . ”
yet no live apes were used .
instead , “ performance capture technology , ” originally invented for the movie Avatar , enables a human actor , Andy Serkis , to play the role of the chimpanzee Caesar , not by dressing in a chimp suit , but by having every gesture and facial movement , even the twitch of an eyebrow , transformed into the movement of an ape .
when I spoke with Wyatt last month , he acknowledged that there were practical reasons for not using real apes in his movie . but he also understood the ethical issue .
“ There are things I didn ’ t want to be involved in , ” he told me . “ To get apes to do anything you want them to do , you have to dominate them ; you have to manipulate them into performing .
that ’ s exploitative . ”
Wyatt ’ s reluctance to join in the exploitation of great apes is understandable , given that the film itself tells the story of apes rising up in response to oppression from dominant humans .
the central human character , Will Rodman ( played by James Franco ) , is a scientist seeking a cure for Alzheimer ’ s disease who experiments on apes .
many films would have glorified a scientist seeking such a goal , and treated the use of animals for that purpose as obviously justified .
rise of the Planet of the Apes , however , portrays Rodman as , in Franco ’ s words , “ a cold , isolated person . ”
only when Rodman ’ s superiors cancel his experiments and he takes home Caesar , an infant chimpanzee , does the scientist begin to care about others .
the plot then takes another turn when Caesar becomes too big and aggressive to live in a human home , and is taken to what is supposed to be a primate sanctuary , but is in fact a dumping ground for unwanted apes , run by humans who display cruelty to the captive animals .
as far as the treatment of apes is concerned , much of the film is firmly grounded in reality , as a viewing of Project Nim , a documentary based on Elizabeth Hess ’ s book Nim Chimpsky : the Chimp Who Would be Human , clearly demonstrates .
Nim was born in 1973 , in a primate research facility in Oklahoma , and was taken from his mother when he was only ten days old , to be used in a sign-language experiment .
Reared as part of a human family , he learned to use more than 100 signs from American Sign Language , the language used by Deaf Americans .
but he was taken from his first human family and handed over to other teachers with whom he did not have the same kind of bond .
he grew stronger and more aggressive and began biting his teachers .
Herbert Terrace , the Columbia University psychologist who was directing the project , decided to end it and sent Nim back to the primate facility in Oklahoma .
there , the pampered chimpanzee – who , when asked to sort photos of humans and apes , put his own photo among the humans – was locked in a cage with other chimps .
he demonstrated his view of that situation by signing “ out ” to passing humans .
Nim suffered various other vicissitudes – and narrowly escaped being infected with hepatitis as part of a medical experiment – until he was eventually released to an animal sanctuary , where he died in 2000 .
in 1993 , Paola Cavalieri and I founded The Great Ape Project , an organization dedicated to the idea of recognizing that great apes have a moral status befitting their nature as self-aware beings who are capable of thought and have rich and deep emotional lives .
at a minimum , they should have the rights to life , liberty , and protection from torture that we grant to all members of our own species , regardless of their intellectual abilities .
in the intervening years , that idea has made steady progress .
since 2010 , the European Union has essentially banned the use of great apes in experiments .
experiments on great apes are now either banned or severely restricted in New Zealand , Australia , and Japan .
in the United States , a bipartisan group of members of Congress is supporting legislation to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive research .
in Spain in 2008 , a parliamentary resolution urged the government to grant some basic legal rights to great apes , but the Spanish government has yet to implement it .
perhaps the release of these two very different films will lead to a further push to bring great apes within the circle of beings with moral and legal rights .
in that way , our closest relatives could serve to bridge the moral gulf that we have dug between ourselves and other animals .
new YORK – In a way , the stir aroused by the decision by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) to indict Sudan ’ s President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur is a surprise .
after all , the Court has no means of its own to arrest anyone in Sudan , much less a head of state who commands the country ’ s armed forces .
nor is there any prospect that someone else will intervene in Sudan to make an arrest .
while the ICC ’ s chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice , it is unclear how this will happen .
but it could .
despite the ICC ’ s seeming powerlessness , many governments ’ leaders are engaged in strenuous efforts to block the indictment .
they do not seem concerned that the charges are unfair ; rather , they appear to be demonstrating solidarity with a fellow head of state .
those denouncing the attempt to put Bashir on trial include the large blocs of countries that are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the African Union , together with such powerful states as China and Russia .
one can only guess whether some of those joining this effort are motivated by concern that they themselves may some day face charges like those leveled at Bashir by the ICC judges .
though Bashir may be able to avoid arrest simply by limiting his international travel , the commotion provoked by the indictment is not irrational .
the charges against him have a powerful stigmatizing effect .
the fact that a panel of judges representing the 108 governments that are parties to the ICC has accused Bashir of principal responsibility for the crimes committed in Darfur during the past six years undermines the legitimacy of his continued rule .
those crimes have caused more than 300,000 deaths , and have forcibly displaced at least another 2.7 million people .
even if Bashir ’ s fellow heads of state succeed in their effort to persuade the United Nations Security Council to defer prosecution – which is highly unlikely – the charges will continue to hang over Bashir ’ s head unless and until he stands trial .
in 1999 , an international criminal tribunal indicted another sitting head of state , Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
though he seemed secure at the time , a year and a half later he was sent to The Hague to stand trial .
similarly , in 2003 , an international criminal tribunal indicted Liberia ’ s then president , Charles Taylor .
he had to flee Liberia a few months later and initially received asylum in Nigeria , but is now on trial in The Hague .
when those indictments were issued , no one could have predicted how events would unfold ; in retrospect , it is evident that the indictments ’ delegitimizing effects had important consequences .
of course , the ICC ’ s prosecutor and judges are themselves taking a substantial risk in the indictment of Bashir .
the Court is still in its infancy , and antagonizing the many government leaders expressing solidarity with him could jeopardize its future .
yet it should be recognized that the Court ’ s personnel are carrying out their duties .
the treaty establishing the ICC explicitly states that heads of state do not enjoy immunity .
and the Security Council referred the Darfur case to the Court in 2005 .
this was an investigation that had to be conducted , and those found to have the highest level of responsibility for the crimes had to be indicted .
many of those now objecting to the prosecution of Bashir participated in the decisions leading to the indictment .
if the ICC ’ s indictment now causes them discomfort , that is only because they did not anticipate that the Court would carry out the responsibilities that they themselves assigned to it .
a few times each year , the world is reminded that a pandemic threat is immanent .
in 2003 , it was SARS .
today , it is a potential avian virus similar to the one that killed 30 million people after 1914 .
“ Bird flu ” has already shown that it can jump from fowl to humans , and now even to cats , which indicates that it might be the next global killer .
but there are many other potential pandemics , and many are not even viruses .
bacteria , prions , parasites , and even environmental factors could suddenly change in a way that slays us .
it is widely predicted that when this happens , the economic and human losses will exceed that of any previous war .
indeed , it is humbling to remember that some of history ’ s most deadly invasions were carried out by single-cell organisms , such as cholera , bubonic plague , and tuberculosis .
countries with the resources to do so are making resistance plans against pandemics – limited strategies that would protect their own citizens .
most governments are hoping that early detection will make containment possible .
containment depends heavily on vaccines , but vaccines are only part of the answer .
while they are a good defense against many viruses , each vaccine is highly specific to the threat .
viruses are parasites to cells , and each virus attacks a particular type of cell .
the virus is shaped so that it can drill into a particular feature of that cell and inject parts of itself inside , confusing the cell into making more viruses and destroying itself in the process .
with their very specific forms , the most effective anti-viral vaccines must be designed for a narrow range of factors .
sometimes the tailored nature of viruses works in our favor .
for example , they usually find it difficult to jump between species , because they would have to change their structure .
but if large numbers of a host – say , birds – encounter a great number of people , eventually the virus will find a way to prosper in a new type of cell .
birds are the greatest concern today only because the spread is easy to see .
but AIDS jumped from monkeys and several types of flu jumped from swine .
deadly mutations of any kind need to be identified urgently , so that an effective vaccine can be designed before the strain becomes comfortable in the human body .
unfortunately our present methods of detection are not sensitive enough .
this is even more worrying when you realize that scientists should also be monitoring bacteria , prions , and parasites .
there are more bacteria than any other life form .
many live harmlessly in our bodies and perform useful functions .
they evolve and adapt easily , which means that they learn to sidestep our drugs over time .
bacteria should be checked for two types of mutation : adaptation by a hostile form that enables it to become super-immune to drugs , or a deadly mutant strain that appears in one of the multitude of “ safe ” bacteria .
prions are a relatively new discovery .
they are made from proteins similar to those that the body uses during healthy operations , which means that they are able to fool the body ’ s tools into making more prions .
they have only recently been recognized as the cause of several infectious diseases , including mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , which kill by crowding out healthy brain cells .
many nerve , respiratory and muscle diseases might also be caused by prions .
finally , parasites , simple animals that infect us , are already classified as pandemics .
malaria afflicts 300 million people and is the world ’ s biggest killer of children .
many parasites are worms : hookworm ( 800 million people infected ) , roundworm ( 1.5 billion ) , schistosomes ( 200 million ) , and the worm that causes Elephantiasis ( 150 million ) .
there are also antagonists that are currently ignored .
environmental chemicals and particulates might warrant their own categories .
or consider combinations of problems , such as these chemical infectors mixing with airborne pollens , and apparently pushing up incidences of asthma .
new fungal infections are even scarier and might be harder to treat .
the bottom line is that we can ’ t predict where the threat will emerge , so we need a distributed , intelligent detection system .
in practical terms , how should it be built ?
“ Detectors ” would have to be expert enough to know when an ordinary-looking symptom is actually an emergency .
they would be located everywhere , with an emphasis on vulnerable regions .
initial warning signs of a pandemic are most likely to appear in the developing world , but detection nodes should be positioned in every country , with the least possible expense .
this is not as difficult as it sounds .
the key is to harness existing infrastructure .
medical infrastructure exists everywhere , in some form .
it also tends to be the least corrupt of institutions in regions where that is a problem .
medical centers and clinics would be expected to investigate the cause of ailments in a large number of their patients , even in cases where the symptoms seem common .
a small amount of additional scientific expertise and lab equipment would need to be added to a public health system that serves ordinary needs .
enhancing existing resources would be effective for two reasons .
first , illness is more likely to be reported in a city hospital than at a specialist institute .
second , the investment would boost latent public health in that region .
for poor regions , investment in equipment and training would have to come from wealthier counterparts .
rich countries could justify the expense in terms of the savings that would result from early detection of a major threat .
tropical climates and urban slums are humanity ’ s front line against pandemics , and they should be equipped properly .
public health is an important asset for any nation .
with so much at stake , it makes sense to place sentinels near every swamp , city , public market , and farmyard on earth .
can a public figure have a private life ?
recent events in three countries have highlighted the importance of this question .
in the French presidential election , both candidates tried to keep their domestic life separate from their campaign .
Ségolène Royal is not married to François Hollande , the father of her four children .
when asked whether they were a couple , Royal replied , “ Our lives belong to us . ” Similarly , in response to rumors that President-elect Nicholas Sarkozy ’ s wife had left him , a spokesman for Sarkozy said , “ That ’ s a private matter . ”
the French have a long tradition of respecting the privacy of their politicians ’ personal lives , and French public opinion is more broad-minded than in the United States , where an unwed mother of four would have no chance of being nominated for the presidency by a major party .
indeed , last month , Randall Tobias , the top foreign aid adviser in the US State Department , resigned after acknowledging that he had used an escort service described as providing “ high-end erotic fantasy ” – although Tobias said he only had a massage .
in Britain , Lord John Browne , the chief executive who transformed BP from a second-tier European oil company into a global giant , resigned after admitting he had lied in court about the circumstances in which he had met a gay companion ( apparently , he met him through a male escort agency ) .
in resigning , he said that he had always regarded his sexuality as a personal matter , and he was disappointed that a newspaper – The Mail on Sunday – had made it public .
candidates for public office , and those holding high administrative or corporate positions , should be judged on their policies and performance , not on private acts that are irrelevant to how well they carry out , or will carry out , their public duties .
sometimes , of course , the two overlap . the Mail on Sunday and its sister paper , The Daily Mail , justified their publication of revelations by Browne ’ s former companion on the grounds that they include allegations that Browne had allowed him to use corporate resources for the benefit of his own private business .
the company denied that there was any substance to these allegations .
as the administrator of the US Agency for International Development , Tobias implemented the Bush administration ’ s policy that requires organizations working against HIV / AIDS to condemn prostitution if they are to be eligible for US assistance .
that policy has been criticized for making it more difficult to assist sex workers who are at high risk of contracting and spreading HIV / AIDS .
arguably , the public has an interest in knowing if those who implement such policies are themselves paying for sexual services .
where there is no suggestion that a matter of personal morality has had an impact on the performance of a business executive or government official , we should respect that person ’ s privacy .
but what about candidates for political leadership ?
since politicians ask us to entrust them with sweeping powers , it can be argued that we should know as much as possible about their morality .
for example , we might reasonably ask whether they pay their fair share of taxes , or inquire about their charitable donations .
such things tell us something about their concern for the public good .
similarly , the revelation three years ago that the then-Australian opposition leader and aspiring prime minister , Mark Latham , had assaulted a taxi driver and broken his arm in a dispute about a fare was relevant for those who believe that a nation ’ s leader should be slow to anger .
but does the legitimate interest in knowing more about a politician extend to details about personal relations ?
it is hard to draw a line of principle around any area and determine if knowledge of it will provide relevant information about a politician ’ s moral character .
the problem is that the media have an interest in publishing information that increases their audience , and personal information , especially of a sexual nature , will often do just that .
even so , whether people choose to marry or not , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , even whether they pay to fulfill their erotic fantasies or have fantasies they can fulfill at no cost , tells us little about whether they are good people who can be trusted with high office – unless , of course , they say one thing while doing another .
if we can cultivate a wider tolerance of human diversity , politicians , business leaders , and administrators would be less fearful of “ exposure , ” because they would realize that they have done nothing that they must hide .
prostitution is illegal in most of the US , including Washington DC , and this could be one reason why Tobias had to resign .
but when New Jersey Governor John Corzine was involved in a serious road accident last month , it became known that he violated his own state ’ s law by not wearing his seat belt .
by any sensible measure , Corzine ’ s violation of the law was more serious than that of Tobias .
laws requiring the wearing of seatbelts save many lives .
laws prohibiting prostitution do no evident good at all , and may well do harm .
yet no one suggested that Corzine should resign because of his foolish and illegal act .
in the US , at least , breaching sexual norms still brings with it a moral opprobrium that is unrelated to any real harm it may do .
WARSAW : the thirteen days that Pope John Paul II spent in Poland this summer will probably be the last that he ever spends in his homeland .
what the Pope wanted to say to the Polish people , and what was understood by them appear , as the nostalgic haze of that journey fades , to have been two very different things .
Pope John Paul II began his pilgrimage in Gdansk , birthplace of Solidarity , with a remembrance mass for St. Adalbert , who introduced Poland to Catholicism some thousand years ago .
St. Adalbert &apos;s evangelism is often called the &quot; baptism of Poland &quot; .
what the Pope sought , indeed , was nothing less than a re-baptism of our country .
in a way , he treated Poland – up to a point – as a pagan country .
his numerous sermons and speeches revealed his intention to restore Adalbert &apos;s spirit in Poland .
John Paul spoke constantly of the need for love , about the love of God , but also about love between people .
in an unprecedented visit to Poland &apos;s parliament -- indeed , his address to the Sejm was the first address to a democratic assembly John Paul II has given in the two decades of his papacy -- he even spoke about love between politicians , although he is clever enough to know that such a thing is practically impossible .
our politicians were happy to hear that they should love each other , though when Pope left they started to quarrel about the meaning of love .
on the last day of his stay , the Pope invited the Polish President , a man with a long communist past , into the &quot; papamobile &quot; , which also was totally unprecedented .
so , what was the meaning of the Pope &apos;s sermons and this behavior ?
first , we can quote the sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf , who often says that democracy and free markets are cold things .
the Pope wanted to show that democracy can be warmed by love , or at least by the fact that real human beings participate in the making of democracy and in the free market .
what was very surprising , particularly given his finger-wagging visits to America and other rich democracies , was that the Pope did not criticize the Polish people for their robust materialism .
in a sense , John Paul II accepted Poland as it is with the hope that people will find more pleasure in democracy and in the free market when they love each other .
Secondly , the Pope recognized the most important problem of Poland and many other young democracies -- the collapse , in the face of material prosperity , of the sense of community .
even the strongest and most important community in Poland , namely the national community , appears imperilled .
individualism is of course a part of liberalism and Polish society is now a very liberal one , but some community feelings are necessary for free individuals to exist .
without a sense of civic and political community , democracy becomes a hollow shell of itself , and can become dangerous as it is no longer controlled by rooted values .
but community cannot be created merely because of common interests .
as Alexis de Tocqueville taught us , community must be a community of values and of patterns of behaviour .
a community based on love need not be a society where people behave like angels .
what the Pope envisioned was a society which is not based on total lack of interest in &quot; thy neighbor &quot; , a society of lonely grasping , but containing a certain amount of loyal , reliable friendship .
during the Pope &apos;s visit , Poles really loved each other and loved the fact that they belonged to a community , but a very short lived community of those who go to papal masses .
in the weeks since John Paul &apos;s plane left Krakow , it is clear that Poles have forgotten everything and things go on as before .
which means they go as in a cold democracy and a brutally cold free market .
why is this so ?
Evangelical values mean little to people whose only purpose is money .
even freedom , which in theory is important for the members of a liberal society , is not much valued in Poland .
democracy in Poland , and probably in all postcommunist countries , was , is , and shall be the freedom to gain money .
one can argue that such is state of affairs elsewhere , but I do not think so .
in some countries , democracy is connected with values which support the welfare state or a society that takes care of its members most of the time .
this is often called &quot; inclusion &quot; .
inclusion in Poland is of no interest to politicians and to businessman , and love , in the Pope &apos;s words , was a form of inclusion .
some months ago Poland faced a wave of peasant strikes .
farmers sought more money , of course , but what they really wanted was inclusion .
since 1989 none of the many Polish governments , which nearly always included the Peasant party ( PSL ) , has shown any interest in a group that constitutes 38 % of society .
I do not intend to praise communism , but before the Second World War 20 % of university students were the offspring of peasants ; now we have barely 1 % .
no one tries to help young people from the provinces go to high schools and afterward to universities .
peasants simply cannot manage in the cold free market .
so they feel utterly disconnected from the process of transformation .
perhaps democracy must be cold as a technique of government but it cannot be cold towards its citizens .
Adam Smith , indeed , was not a theorist of the cold free market , but one of the greatest moralists of the Enlightenment .
the Pope was , therefore , right when he called for more love and was wrong when he hoped that people would listen .
perhaps , after the first brutal generation of democratic rule , a slightly more moral society will arise and the Pope &apos;s words will be recalled from a distance .
now they are ignored as we , solitarily , grub for the rewards of our material freedom .
Moscow : Vladimir Putin has more to celebrate than his election as Russia ’ s president in his own right .
after a decade of horrific turmoil , Russia ’ s economy is at last turning around .
recently , the Moscow brokers Brunswick Warburg predicted that Russia ’ s GDP will surge 5 % this year .
that growth should give President Putin - if he is patient and persistent - leeway to tackle the longer term reforms his country needs if it is to become the powerful state he seeks it to be .
until now , a broad consensus forecast 1-2 % growth in Russia this year .
the reason behind that uninspiring consensus is simple : people - economists and investors alike - have become so pessimistic about Russia that they no longer can see positive facts .
the conventional wisdom is that Russian industrial growth is only an effect of high oil prices and import substitution , facilitated by a great devaluation of the ruble .
considering that Russia ’ s growth was 3.2 % last year , a staggering 8.8 % in the last quarter , this makes little sense .
growth , indeed , is accelerating .
dynamism like this does not stop without a major shock .
industrial growth was 8.1 % last year , and has accelerated since , to 14 % in February .
oil and gas have not led the recovery ; indeed , they stagnated last year .
major industries with 16-22 % growth were chemicals , light manufacturing , pulp and paper , and machine building ; that is , intermediary goods and simple manufacturing , exactly the kind of industries economists like to see expanding at this stage of a recovery .
within each industry , the best enterprises dash ahead , as should be the case when real restructuring is taking place .
another tired argument is that Russia ’ s growth is superficial and not generated by investment .
however , recovery in transition economies from Estonia to Poland to Hungary is usually export led .
investments tend to follow recovery , as there is so much underutilized capital around .
even so , investment actually increased by 6 % in 1999 and is rising further .
but the most over-hyped argument concerns Russia ’ s feeble tax collection .
but this obscures the real issue , which is excessive government expenditures .
last year the government put its finances in order by cutting wasteful and corrupt expenditures , such as enterprise subsidies .
the total government budget deficit stopped at 1.7 % of GDP .
this year it will be nearly eliminated .
barter and arrears ( ie , debts between factories and firms ) , long major concerns , are also diminishing .
since the financial crash of August 1998 all kinds of arrears have fallen by two / thirds in real terms and barter by half .
one reason was that in 1999 almost 10,000 loss-making Russian enterprises were put into bankruptcy .
the financial crash introduced hard budget constraints on Russian enterprises ; they realized they had to make money , prompting rapid monetization .
today , we are seeing the structural changes that we had hoped to see years ago .
Russia is getting some return from the substantial structural reforms it has actually undertaken .
the last real worry was the foreign balance .
Russia has a substantial foreign debt service , but the recent London Club deal reduced Soviet-era debt to commercial banks by half , easing the pressure mightily .
a similar deal is likely in the Paris Club for the regulation of debts to governments .
during the last few months Russia ’ s international reserves have grown sharply , as one would expect of a country with a staggering trade surplus of $ 33 billion this year and which is likely to surge to over $ 40 billion this year .
of course , Russia is still hemorrhaging money .
but the cause of Russia ’ s so-called capital flight is a poor bank system and its dysfunctional tax system .
Fortunately , Russia now has such liberal currency regulations that Russians can keep their money in good international banks instead .
all of these changes mark the beginning of the end of the era of the oligarchs , ushered in with the presidential elections of 1996 .
Mr. Putin has no need for the oligarchs to provide him with media support to avert a communist threat or offer a conduit for covert state financing .
to him , Boris Berezovsky and his cronies are a nuisance ; most are already been broken to Putin ’ s will .
instead , a new group of Russian businessmen , mainly manufacturers , are rising .
their increasing strength is a reflection of robust economic growth , which promotes production for the market rather than sheer redistribution of resources , implying a new sort of politics .
last October , McKinsey Global Institute published a major empirical report of Russian industry .
its conclusion was that Russia had real and human capital suitable to sustain a growth rate of 8 % a year , and that its problem was primarily the distortions imposed by a poorly functioning tax system and the absence of a land market .
however , neither the bank system nor the legal system were actually impediments at this stage of development .
they will become important as Russia moves to the next stage of growth , and so these new businessmen are demanding these reforms .
Mr. Putin is no great thinker or reformer , but he is astute and genuinely popular .
he is likely to surf on the current wave of economic growth , using broad consensus about the need for reform to clean up the state administration , and liberalize a tax regime which , though grossly inefficient , is heavy-handed when it goes after a company .
land reform remains so controversial he may shrink from addressing the issue .
my greatest worry is not Putin but that Russia will face an excessive inflow of foreign portfolio investment again , as in 1997 .
Fortunately , the bond markets are dead , and it might take a year to revive them .
their absence makes it difficult to invest too large amounts of money in Russian securities .
something fundamental has changed in the Russian economy .
a time comes when all disasters have occurred and all stupidities are recognized .
for Russia , August 1998 marked that dividing line .
it was a horrendous shock , imposing great social costs , but it changed Russia ’ s mentality , not only the exchange rate .
SYDNEY – Spectators at February ’ s Daytona 500 in Florida were handed green flags to wave in celebration of the news that the race ’ s stock cars now use gasoline with 15 % corn-based ethanol .
it was the start of a season-long television marketing campaign to sell the merits of biofuel to Americans .
on the surface , the self-proclaimed “ greening of NASCAR ” ( National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ) is merely a transparent ( and , one suspects , ill-fated ) exercise in an environmental form of whitewashing for the sport – call it “ greenwashing . ”
but the partnership between a beloved American pastime and the biofuel lobby also marks the latest attempt to sway public opinion in favor of a truly irresponsible policy .
the United States spends about $ 6 billion a year on federal support for ethanol production through tax credits , tariffs , and other programs .
thanks to this financial assistance , one-sixth of the world ’ s corn supply is burned in American cars .
that is enough corn to feed 350 million people for an entire year .
government support of rapid growth in biofuel production has contributed to disarray in food production .
indeed , as a result of official policy in the US and Europe , including aggressive production targets , biofuel consumed more than 6.5 % of global grain output and 8 % of the world ’ s vegetable oil in 2010 , up from 2 % of grain supplies and virtually no vegetable oil in 2004 .
this year , after a particularly bad growing season , we see the results .
global food prices are the highest they have been since the United Nations started tracking them in 1990 , pushed up largely by increases in the cost of corn .
despite the strides made recently against malnutrition , millions more people will be undernourished than would have been the case in the absence of official support for biofuels .
we have been here before .
in 2007 and 2008 , the swift increase in biofuel production caused a food crisis that incited political instability and fueled malnutrition .
developed countries did not learn .
since 2008 , ethanol production has increased by 33 % .
biofuels were initially championed by environmental campaigners as a silver bullet against global warming .
they started to change their minds as a stream of research showed that biofuels from most food crops did not significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and in many cases , caused forests to be destroyed to grow more food , creating more net carbon-dioxide emissions than fossil fuels .
some green activists supported mandates for biofuel , hoping they would pave the way for next-generation ethanol , which would use non-food plants .
that has not happened .
today , it is difficult to find a single environmentalist who still backs the policy .
even former US Vice President and Nobel laureate Al Gore – who once boasted of casting the deciding vote for ethanol support – calls the policy “ a mistake . ”
he now admits that he supported it because he “ had a certain fondness for the &#91; corn &#93; farmers in the state of Iowa ” – who , not coincidentally , were crucial to his 2000 presidential bid .
it is refreshing that Gore has now changed his view in line with the evidence .
but there is a wider lesson .
a chorus of voices from the left and right argue against continued government support for biofuel .
the problem , as Gore has put it , is that “ it ’ s hard once such a program is put in place to deal with the lobbies that keep it going . ”
politicians can ’ t stop such rent-seeking behavior .
what they can do is craft well-considered policies that maximize social welfare .
unfortunately , when it comes to policies marketed as reining in global warming , protecting the environment , or creating “ green jobs , ” we have a tendency to make hasty decisions that don ’ t pass the test .
government support for biofuel is only one example of a knee-jerk “ green ” policy that creates lucrative opportunities for a self-interested group of businesses but does very little to help the planet .
consider the financial support afforded early-generation renewable-energy companies .
Germany led the world in putting up solar panels , funded by $ 75 billion in subsidies .
the result ?
inefficient , uncompetitive solar technology sitting on rooftops in a fairly cloudy country , delivering a trivial 0.1 % of Germany ’ s total energy supply , and postponing the effects of global warming by seven hours in 2100 .
given the financial stakes , it is little wonder that alternative-energy companies , “ green ” investment firms , and biofuel producers are lobbying hard for more government largesse , and marketing their cause directly to the public by highlighting its supposed benefits for the environment , energy security , and even employment – none of which withstand scrutiny . “ The NASCAR deal will push American ethanol into the stratosphere , ” declared Tom Buis , CEO of the ethanol trade association Growth Energy .
at least one group is already sold : presidential contenders .
in Iowa last month , possible Republican candidate Newt Gingrich derided “ big-city attacks ” on ethanol subsidies .
and , in what must be music to the industry ’ s ears , an Obama administration official declared that even amidst the highest food prices the world has seen , there is “ no reason to take the foot off the gas ” on biofuel .
in fact , there are millions of reasons – all of them suffering needlessly – to apply the brakes .
Argentina &apos;s president , Eduardo Duhalde , has been making impassioned pleas for international support to rebuild his country .
Argentina needs and deserves such help , and the foundations for economic success-skills ( a literate and well-educated population ) and institutions ( a federal constitutional democracy ) -have been in place for a long time .
but Mr Duhalde has yet to specify what must be done to take advantage of Argentina &apos; favorable endowments .
he does at least recognize that only Argentina is responsible for the bad policy choices that led to today &apos;s morass .
no one forced Argentina to adopt the currency board devised by Domingo Cavallo , the former economy minister , which pegged the peso to the dollar at a fixed exchange rate of one to one .
( the IMF , however , clearly should not have helped finance the currency board &apos;s operation without demanding fiscal adjustment when the country liberalized its foreign trade . )
as a result of the currency peg , Argentina &apos;s interest rates were largely determined in the US .
lacking access to basic economic tools such as exchange rate and monetary policies , Argentina could not surmount the profound external shocks of the second half of the 1990s , when export prices fell , the US dollar appreciated , and Brazil , the country &apos;s main trading partner , devalued its currency .
the only alternative was severe fiscal austerity , for which the government never mustered the political will .
Argentina is now in a deep recession , with unemployment above 30 % , and a shattered banking and financial system .
fiscal austerity and balanced budgets should be priorities in the longer term , but they are inappropriate now .
the first priority should be boosting employment to enable citizens to put food on the table and recover a basic sense of confidence in the future .
otherwise , the country &apos;s impoverishment will continue to deplete its middle class and lead many young and capable professionals to emigrate .
it will also sustain unprecedented levels of violence and criminality-another crucial dimension of today &apos;s insecurity .
to jump-start the economy , the government must promote exports , particularly in the manufacturing and agro-industrial sectors , as well as tourism and infrastructure construction projects .
after all , there can be no reliance on domestic consumption or private investment to turn the tide .
higher exports will also generate the foreign exchange needed to resume external debt payments , now in default .
but Argentina &apos;s exporters will need help in returning to foreign markets , such as removal of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers by rich countries .
the country has already shown that under favorable conditions its exports can compete and grow rapidly .
according to World Bank data , 32 % of Argentina &apos;s exports are manufactured goods , with roughly one-quarter classified as high-technology products .
from 1991 to 2001 , total exports grew from about $ 12 billion to $ 27 billion ( an average annual growth rate of about 8.5 % ) , despite the overvalued currency .
President Duhalde has specifically requested the help of the IMF , the World Bank , and the Inter-American Development Bank .
such assistance should be forthcoming , and in order to avoid bureaucratic overlap and turf conflicts , the responsibilities and priorities in dispensing it should be spelled out and agreed upon in advance by the government and these organizations .
specifically , the IMF should be responsible for advice related to overall macroeconomic policy , as well as for assembling the financial package required to support the government while it implements its program of economic reactivation and reform of the financial sector .
the IMF should also provide technical and financial assistance to support a long-term program aimed at redefining the fiscal responsibility of the central and provincial governments .
true fiscal decentralization must take hold if the central government is ever to regain full control of public finances .
the World Bank should provide technical and financial assistance to support a reorganized judiciary .
this must include making the appointment of federal and Supreme Court judges free from nepotism and political influence .
a shameful legacy of President Menem &apos;s government in the 1990s was that it prevented the investigation and prosecution of serious improprieties , corruption , illegal arms sales , and major terrorist acts .
finally , the Inter-American Development Bank should assist with programs designed to promote and finance industrial exports , as well as underwriting tourism projects .
these are areas in which the Bank has substantial experience in Latin America .
Argentina deserves the international support it is requesting .
at a time of deep recession , such support should not be made contingent on reaching unattainable fiscal objectives .
fiscal consolidation should be a condition for the longer-term aid that international organizations will have to provide .
but the first priority must be putting people back to work .
addressing the glaring shortcomings in the country &apos;s judicial system should also be made a condition for support , both as an immediate and a long-term objective .
under any economic circumstances , denial of justice , and poor implementation of the country &apos;s laws , must be remedied as quickly as possible .
for , at the most fundamental level , what is at stake in Argentina is not merely the health of the economy , but the quality of its civil society .
the assassination of the President of Iraq &apos;s Governing Council makes it crystal clear that the US is failing to create the minimal law-and-order needed for any sort of orderly transfer of power to take place by June 30th .
barely two months ago , the signing of a constitutional document by a US-appointed group of un-elected Iraqi officials was heralded as if it were the re-enactment of America &apos;s constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787 .
but by now it is clear that this is a worthless piece of paper .
no imposed constitution , however elegant it may be , will be very helpful to Coalition forces when confronted with the type of mayhem seen in towns like Fallujah or Najjaf .
in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq , however , the situation is completely different : in the last ten years , under the protection of the Allies &apos; no-fly zone , and even more so since the toppling of Saddam , the Kurdish regional government has been able to establish and sustain a relatively orderly administration .
it has overcome tribal and party differences and created ade facto functioning government , with an impressive record on development issues such as education , irrigation , and construction - and , above all , with no violence .
confronted with the debacle in the rest of ( Arab ) Iraq , the question has to be asked why the US-led coalition should not hold a referendum in the Kurdish region , asking the population how they would like to be ruled .
after all , the Kurds have , by any internationally accepted standards , a right to self-determination .
historically , the Kurds - who are distinct in language , culture , and historical consciousness from Arabs - never had their day in court .
after World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire , the victorious Allies promised them a state of their own - a promise that was cynically betrayed when British and French imperial interests took precedence .
since then , the Kurds have suffered under the despotic rule of rival ethnic groups .
there are obvious obstacles to holding such a referendum , primarily because the US does not have a mandate to dispose of Iraq as it pleases .
but the same goes for the rest of Iraq : the US is now lamely asking for a UN resolution mandating a transfer of power to a legitimate Iraqi government - but such an authorization is highly unlikely , nor is there anyone in Iraq to whom authority can conceivably be transferred .
why should the one region - and people - who run an orderly government , are not involved in murder , attacks on mosques , and suicide bombing of schoolchildren , be penalized ?
another objection is the opposition of Turkey - and , to a lesser degree , Iran and Syria - to granting the Iraqi Kurds self-determination .
but if one thinks in terms of universal norms of human rights , what right has Turkey to dictate internal development in another country ?
after all , nobody accepts Israel &apos;s claim to oppose as a matter of principle the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza .
the same should apply to Turkey .
if Turkey grants its own Kurdish minority more cultural and language rights and allows legitimate Kurdish political representation in the Turkish parliament , the willingness of Turkish Kurds to oppose Ankara will be diminished .
in the nineteenth century , the joint interests of the authoritarian Russian , German , and Austrian Empires prevented the establishment of a free Poland : such unholy alliances have no place in the twenty-first century .
recently , under the aegis of the UN , a referendum on the future of Cyprus was held within the island &apos;s Greek and Turkish communities .
the outcome was paradoxical , and not to the liking of those who initiated it : but the right of the communities to determine their future was accepted .
why not in Iraqi Kurdistan ?
perhaps to assuage political fears - and considerations of international law - any plebiscite in the Kurdish region should , initially , have only a consultative status .
but it will give legitimate expression to the will of a people long oppressed and entitled to their place in the sun .
such a referendum may also concentrate minds among the Arab Sunnis and Shia in Iraq , when they come to realize that it is their violence that is dismantling Iraq .
perhaps they may decide that violence is counter-productive and carries its own penalties , and may then follow the Kurdish example of curbing violence , which would help put Iraq together again without recourse to permanent repression .
if not , at the very least , the injustice suffered by the Kurdish people for generations would , at long last , be rectified .
STANFORD – Successful political candidates try to implement the proposals on which they ran .
in the United States , President Barack Obama and the Democrats , controlling the House of Representatives and ( a filibuster-proof ) Senate , had the power to do virtually anything they wanted in 2009 – and so they did .
Obama and his congressional allies enacted an $ 800 billion “ stimulus ” bill that was loaded with programs geared to key Democratic constituencies , such as environmentalists and public employees ; adopted a sweeping and highly unpopular health-care reform ( whose constitutionality will be determined by the Supreme Court this year ) ; imposed vast new regulations on wide swaths of the economy ; embraced an industrial policy that selects certain companies for special treatment ; engaged in borrowing and spending at levels exceeded only in World War II ; and centralized power in Washington , DC ( and , within the federal government , in the executive branch and regulatory agencies ) .
the last election that was followed by such a sweeping change in policy direction occurred in 1980 , when President Ronald Reagan overhauled taxes , spending , and regulation , and supported the Federal Reserve ’ s course of disinflation .
while the 1988 , 1992 , and 2000 elections were also quite consequential , the policy shifts were not nearly as large as in 1980 and 2008 .
the country rebelled against Obama and the Democrats ’ lurch to the left with historic Congressional election victories for Republicans in 2010 .
since then , many Republicans have been deeply disappointed that the House of Representatives has been unable to roll back much of Obama ’ s agenda .
but the US political system is set up to make it much harder to accomplish something than to block it .
it is not easy to do a lot while controlling only one-half of one-third of the federal government .
the 2012 election is shaping up as a referendum on Obama ’ s policies and performance .
the economy is improving slowly , but it remains in bad shape , with high unemployment and millions having left the labor force .
Republicans are expected to retain control of the House and regain a majority in the Senate .
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , the Republican frontrunner to challenge Obama in November , and the party ’ s other leading candidates , including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , want less spending , major reforms of government programs , lower taxes , trade expansion , and less and more-targeted regulation than does Obama .
Romney , for example , has a detailed 59-point economic program , including a cap on federal spending at 20 % of GDP , which would require reductions similar to those in the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s .
Gingrich and the other Republicans have an even more aggressive agenda of cutting taxes and reducing the size and scope of government .
the eventual nominee would be wise to incorporate his opponents ’ best ideas and top people into his campaign .
a Republican presidential victory , together with Republican control of the House and Senate , would likely lead to substantial reduction , repeal , and replacement of many Obama initiatives , attempts to reform taxes and entitlements , and measures to impose greater fiscal discipline .
high on Romney ’ s agenda is a reduction of the corporate-tax rate , from 35 % to 25 % , the OECD average level ( the other Republican candidates would lower it still more ) , which would redress a major competitive disadvantage for American multinational companies ’ global business .
a Republican victory would also most likely lead to a major push to open up many more energy-exploration opportunities within America , which Obama has stymied .
Romney has promised tougher negotiations on trade and currency with China , but is generally far more likely to push new trade agreements than the labor-supported Obama administration .
if , however , Democrats retain control of the Senate , this will be far more difficult to accomplish .
a Republican president also would make appointments to many key policymaking positions , from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to regulatory agencies .
if Obama is re-elected , and Republicans control the House and Senate , his legislative agenda will essentially be a dead letter , and he will spend the next two years , at least , negotiating its reform and rollback .
in this scenario , the policy center of gravity in the Republican party would shift to House Speaker John Boehner , the chairman of the House Budget Committee , Paul Ryan , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , and other key Representatives , including David Camp , Kevin Brady , and Kevin McCarthy , along with several Senators .
in that case , Obama would be wise to move to the center ( as Bill Clinton did after the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994 ) and work with congressional Republicans to shape sensible tax and entitlement reforms .
but that seems unlikely : since the Democrats ’ massive defeat in 2010 , Obama has moved even further to the left , embracing a more populist agenda .
regardless of the outcome of this year ’ s presidential and congressional elections , various Republican state governors are likely to gain a higher national profile .
all of them – &amp; nbsp ; including Mitch Daniels of Indiana , Chris Christie of New Jersey , Bob McDonnell of Virginia , and former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida – declined to seek the Republican presidential nomination , but will be on the short list for 2016 should Obama win in November .
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously described the states as “ laboratories ” : they should be allowed to experiment and learn from each other which policies work .
for example , Clinton and the Republican Congress based landmark 1996 welfare reform on policies originated by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and successfully emulated by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , both reformist Republicans .
the current cohort of Republican governors offers similarly innovative state-level solutions – for example , on spending , debt , and unfunded pension and health liabilities – as models for the country .
until November , divided government and contentious campaigning will most likely prevent significant policy moves .
but , following the election , taxes and spending , trade policy , federalism , regulation , and defense will take a different course – how different depends on who wins – with important implications for America ’ s fiscal position , external balance , and much else , including its relations with the rest of the world .
Copenhagen – Common sense was an early loser in the scorching battle over the reality of man-made global warming .
for nearly 20 years , one group of activists argued – in the face of ever-mounting evidence – that global warming was a fabrication .
their opponents , meanwhile , exaggerated the phenomenon ’ s likely impact – and , as a consequence , dogmatically fixated on drastic , short-term carbon cuts as the only solution , despite overwhelming evidence that such cuts would be cripplingly expensive and woefully ineffective .
this scientific pie fight , characterized by juvenile name-calling , ignoble tactics , and intellectual intransigence on both sides , not only left the public confused and scared ; it undermined the efforts of the most important organizations working on advancing the science of climate change .
almost inevitably , at international summits from Kyoto to Copenhagen , governments failed to take any meaningful action on global warming .
Fortunately , there finally seems to be a growing number of influential scientists , economists , and politicians who represent a more sensible approach to the issue .
as I argued in my 2007 book Cool It , the most rational response to global warming is to make alternative energy technologies so cheap that the whole world can afford them .
in broad strokes , this requires a deliberate and significant boost to research and development spending .
based on recent work by Isabel Galiana and Chris Green of McGill University , I advocate expenditure totaling around 0.2 % of global GDP – roughly $ 100 billion a year .
of course , no fix to global warming will work overnight .
so we need to focus more on adapting to the effects of global warming – for example , by stepping up efforts to cope with inland flooding and the urban “ heat island ” effect .
at the same time , we should explore the practicality of climate engineering , which we may need to buy more time for a smooth transition away from fossil fuels .
acknowledging that man-made climate change is real , but arguing that carbon cuts are not the answer , amounts to staking out a middle ground in the global warming debate – which means being attacked from both sides .
for so-called “ alarmists , ” pointing out what ’ s wrong with drastic carbon cuts is somehow tantamount to denying the reality of climate change , while so-called “ deniers ” lambast anyone who accepts the scientific evidence supporting this “ mythical ” problem .
nevertheless , there are encouraging signs that the minority of sensible voices in this debate are beginning to get the attention they deserve .
in mid-2009 , as part of a project by the Copenhagen Consensus Center to assess different responses to global warming , Green and Galiana performed a cost-benefit analysis of R &amp; amp ; D spending on green technologies .
green , a long-time proponent of a technology-led response to global warming , demonstrated the effectiveness of a policy of government investment in R &amp; amp ; D aimed at developing new low-carbon technologies , making current technologies cheaper and more effective , and expanding energy-related infrastructure such as smart grids .
as Green and Galiana bluntly noted , “ No approach to climate stabilization will work without an energy technology revolution . ”
another academic who has advocated a smarter response to global warming is Roger Pielke , Jr. of the University of Colorado , the author of this year ’ s must-read global-warming book The Climate Fix .
along with Green , Pielke was one of 14 noted academics who co-wrote February ’ s “ Hartwell Paper , ” commissioned by the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford .
the paper made the case for developing alternatives to fossil fuels , ensuring that economic development doesn ’ t wreak environmental havoc , and recognizing the importance of adaptation to climate change .
in the US , we witnessed an equally promising development in the climate debate just last month , when the conservative American Enterprise Institute , the liberal Brookings Institution , and the centrist Breakthrough Institute teamed up to publish a report that called for revamping America ’ s energy system with the aim of making clean energy cheap .
entitled “ Post-Partisan Power , ” the report comprehensively and convincingly argues that the US government should invest roughly $ 25 billion per year ( about 0.2 % of America ’ s GDP ) in low-carbon military procurement , R &amp; amp ; D , and a new network of university-private sector innovation hubs to create an “ energy revolution . ”
this sensible proposal predictably drew fire from committed “ alarmists ” and “ deniers . ”
but , promisingly – and surprisingly , given the somewhat toxic state of US politics – it attracted broad support and intelligent commentary from many mainstream pundits .
adding to the swell of voices , November will see the documentary film based on my book ‘ Cool It ’ released in the US .
it is too early to suggest that politicians might make real progress toward implementing genuinely effective policies on climate change .
but , given the dearth of common sense in recent years , the mere fact that a growing chorus of reasonable voices can now be heard is nothing short of miraculous .
in the days after the so-called &quot; Roadmap for Peace between Israel and Palestine &quot; was unveiled , a new cycle of violence exploded between the warring parties .
Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli attacks against Palestinian leaders came with such speed and ferocity that determining who was striking first and who was counterattacking became impossible .
of course , recriminations also began immediately , with Israelis and Palestinians each accusing the other of deliberately destroying the peace process .
the truth , as usual , is more complicated , and understanding it helps us to comprehend what will be needed if real peace is to be achieved .
there are at least four sides to this conflict : moderate and extremist Israelis and moderate and extremist Palestinians .
complicated strategic interactions exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians , but also within the two sides .
the extremist positions are clear .
extremist Palestinians vow to fight until Israel--viewed as a colonial imposition on the Islamic world--is destroyed .
extremist Israelis vow to fight to hold the entire West Bank , pushing out the Palestinians if necessary .
for them , Israel &apos;s pre-1967 borders , the entire city of Jerusalem , and the West Bank of the Jordan River is land given to the Jewish people by God .
no land-for-peace deal will satisfy either side .
large majorities on both sides--perhaps two-thirds or even three-fourths of each population--would accept a return by Israel to something like its pre-1967 borders in exchange for real peace .
of course , moderates on both sides would prefer as much land and room to maneuver as possible , but they prefer a negotiated compromise aimed at ending the violence .
the moderates are understandably wary .
compromise on their side if met by extremism on the other would incite disaster .
if Israel returns to its pre-1967 borders , only to find continuing hostility and terrorism among the Palestinians , Israel will have gravely weakened its security for nothing .
if Palestinians disarm but still confront Israeli demands to keep West Bank settlements , then Palestine will never have a viable state .
compromise is therefore difficult even among moderates : it requires a belief that moderation on one side will be met by moderation on the other .
the Oslo Peace Process was built on the premise that moderates on both sides would gradually gain each other &apos;s trust and move steadily towards compromise .
but this largely ignored the role of extremists .
Israeli extremists assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , lest he mobilize broad public support to make peace .
Arab extremists launched attacks against Israelis civilians , in part to show moderates on both sides that compromise would not stick .
that dynamic is still at work .
Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Mazen has called on Palestinian extremists to disarm , or at least to accept a prolonged cease-fire , but they have responded with more terrorist attacks .
Israel &apos;s government , meanwhile , has gone out of its way to attack Palestinian hard-line groups , causing more death , damage , and bitter feelings .
extremists on both sides &quot; win &quot; their battle to undermine the peace process .
but all factions lose , because violence continues and none of them achieves its goals .
Israelis and Palestinians cannot find the way out alone , because neither side would dare to forcibly disarm its own extremists without absolute proof that the other side will do the same .
so it is fatuous for Israel &apos;s government to insist that the Palestinians disarm completely before the peace process can continue , when Palestinian moderates have no proof that Israel will withdraw to the pre-1967 boundaries .
in these circumstances , gradual confidence building will not work .
extremists simply have enough power to undermine a process based on trust alone .
nor will one side &apos;s extremists defeat the other side &apos;s extremists .
Israel &apos;s military has failed to destroy Palestinian terrorism through hard-line reprisals ; Palestinian extremists have not scared Israeli hard-liners into concessions .
a solution is possible only if the outside world is prepared to police an agreement reached between the moderate majorities .
a strong international peacekeeping force , agreed by the UN , and perhaps led by the US or NATO , must be placed between the warring sides , and must be prepared to suffer losses to terrorists in the service of peace .
the roadmap is--so far--silent on this issue .
when UN Secretary General Kofi Annan made such a proposal , extremists on both sides denounced the plan .
but moderates raised red flags , too .
would a peacekeeping force truly serve the interests of the agreement , rather than one side or the other ?
would it have the firepower to hold back extremists ?
would it stick to its long-term mission in the face of inevitable attacks ?
would peacekeepers withdraw at one side &apos;s insistence ( as UN peacekeepers have retreated in other circumstances , including just before the 1967 Six Day War ) , putting the other side in jeopardy ?
the Roadmap to Peace can work only if both sides are pressed to a real compromise , whose outline is clear : Israel &apos;s return to something like its pre-1967 borders ; financial compensation of Palestinians for losses of land in Israel , rather than a right to return ; and Jerusalem as a shared capital .
but enforcement of this compromise against extremists will require putting credible and well-armed international peacekeepers in place to hold the parties to the deal .
designing such an international peacekeeping effort , one with the credibility and staying power , should now be a priority .
Washington , DC – Just over a hundred years ago , the United States led the world in terms of rethinking how big business worked – and when the power of such firms should be constrained .
in retrospect , the breakthrough legislation – not just for the US , but also internationally – was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 .
the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill , which is about to pass the US Senate , does something similar – and long overdue – for banking .
prior to 1890 , big business was widely regarded as more efficient and generally more modern than small business .
most people saw the consolidation of smaller firms into fewer , large firms as a stabilizing development that rewarded success and allowed for further productive investment .
the creation of America as a major economic power , after all , was made possible by giant steel mills , integrated railway systems , and the mobilization of enormous energy reserves through such ventures as Standard Oil .
but ever-bigger business also had a profound social impact , and here the ledger entries were not all in the positive column .
the people who ran big business were often unscrupulous , and in some cases used their dominant market position to drive out their competitors – enabling the surviving firms subsequently to restrict supply and raise prices .
there was dominance , to be sure , in the local and regional markets of mid-nineteenth-century America , but nothing like what developed in the 50 years that followed .
big business brought major productivity improvements , but it also increased the power of private companies to act in ways that were injurious to the broader marketplace – and to society .
the Sherman Act itself did not change this situation overnight , but , once President Theodore Roosevelt decided to take up the cause , it became a powerful tool that could be used to break up industrial and transportation monopolies .
by doing so , Roosevelt and those who followed in his footsteps shifted the consensus .
Roosevelt ’ s first case , against Northern Securities in 1902 , was immensely controversial .
but the break-up , a decade later , of Standard Oil – perhaps the most powerful company in the history of the world to that date – was seen by mainstream opinion as completely reasonable .
and the break-up of Standard Oil took place in great American style : the company was split into more than 30 pieces , the shareholders did very well , and the Rockefeller family went on to rehabilitate itself in the eyes of the American public .
why are these antitrust tools not used against today ’ s megabanks , which have become so powerful that they can sway legislation and regulation massively in their favor , while also receiving generous taxpayer-financed bailouts as needed ?
the answer is that the kind of power that big banks wield today is very different from what was imagined by the Sherman Act ’ s drafters – or by the people who shaped its application in the early years of the twentieth century .
the banks do not have monopoly pricing power in the traditional sense , and their market share – at the national level – is lower than what would trigger an antitrust investigation in the non-financial sectors .
effective size caps on banks were imposed by the banking reforms of the 1930 ’ s , and there was an effort to maintain such restrictions in the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 .
but all of these limitations fell by the wayside during the wholesale deregulation of the past 15 years .
now , however , a new form of antitrust arrives – in the form of the Kanjorski Amendment , whose language was embedded in the Dodd-Frank bill .
once the bill becomes law , federal regulators will have the right and the responsibility to limit the scope of big banks and , as necessary , break them up when they pose a “ grave risk ” to financial stability .
this is not a theoretical possibility – such risks manifested themselves quite clearly in late 2008 and into early 2009 .
it remains uncertain , of course , whether the regulators would actually take such steps .
but , as Representative Paul Kanjorski , the main force behind the provision , recently put it , “ The key lesson of the last decade is that financial regulators must use their powers , rather than coddle industry interests . ”
and Kanjorski probably is right that not much would be required . “ If just one regulator uses these extraordinary powers &#91; to break up too-big-to-fail banks &#93; just once , ” he says , “ it will send a powerful message , ” one that would “ significantly reform how all financial services firms behave forever more . ”
regulators can do a great deal , but they need political direction from the highest level in order to make genuine progress .
Teddy Roosevelt , of course , preferred to “ Speak softly and carry a big stick . ” The Kanjorski Amendment is a very big stick .
who will pick it up ?
no secret file is being used to secure a guilty verdict .
the proceedings are held in open court , notin camera .
yet the trial of Colonel Yuri Budanov in the city of Rostov-on-Don on charges of kidnapping , raping and murdering an 18 year old Chechen girl named Elsa Kungaeva contains echoes of the notorious Dreyfus affair that divided France a century ago .
at that time , the French army was licking its wounds from the defeat at Sedan and the creation of Bismarck &apos;s imperial Germany .
in the words of one of the French novelist Anatole France &apos;s characters in a novel written at the time , esteem for the army &quot; is all that is left of our glorious past .
it consoles us for the present and gives us hope of the future . &quot;
an exaggerated sense of lost glory helped incite the French Army to fake the evidence that convicted Captain Alfred Dreyfus of spying for the Kaiser .
today &apos;s Russian army is not the bastion of reactionary monarchism and anti-Semitism that shaped French officers &apos; behavior in the Dreyfus affair .
but the army &apos;s bitterresentiment at the demise of Russia &apos;s superpower status , reinforced by the military &apos;s own humiliating loss of resources and prestige , is no less evident .
the army &apos;s exalted , tormented , and wounded pride appears to be shaping both its response to Budanov &apos;s trial as well as that of President Vladimir Putin &apos;s Kremlin .
to Russia &apos;s officer corps , all opponents areipso facto the army &apos;s enemies and , by extension , enemies of Russia .
unlike their turn-of-the-19th-century French counterparts , however , Russia &apos;s officer corps is essentially apolitical , despite decades of dictatorship .
military officers are not overwhelmingly communist in their political leanings , not exclusively ethnic Russians , and not necessarily nationalists .
some officers are all of these , and most are some of them .
but the army as a whole is not anti-democratic .
it appears to have mostly learned its lesson about keeping out of politics , having been drawn into the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev in August , 1991 , only to switch sides when young officers and conscripts balked at carrying out orders .
nevertheless , although President Putin is working to make it a more professional body than the Soviet-era mass army , the officer corps retains a Bolshevik mind-set barricaded against the intrusions of civilian criticism .
poorly paid , slowly promoted , and often drearily garrisoned in Siberian towns , the army &apos;s sole recompense nowadays is prestige : the honors , immunities and cachet of a caste ; in short , the esteem in which it is held because of the victories over Napoleon and Hitler .
Colonel Budanov &apos;s trial challenges this ingrained sense of honor .
when the proceedings began a year ago , democratic Russia seemed to be catching up at long last with the civilized world in holding military officers accountable to the rule of law .
Russian liberals initially welcomed the Budanov case as a sign that the country might address accusations that war crimes were committed in Chechnya .
last month , however , the military prosecutor accepted Colonel Budanov &apos;s argument that he was temporarily insane when he killed the girl , and so acquitted Budanov on the charge of murder .
( the rape charge , for some unclear reason , had already been dropped . )
the prosecution then began to speak of the young girl as a Chechen sniper , from a family of snipers .
outraged , Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov dismissed the prosecutor , who seemed ready to acquit the patriotic &quot; hero &quot; on all remaining charges .
a new prosecutor revived the investigation , reinstated the charges , and balked at accepting a plea of not guilty due to insanity .
Ivanov , however , apparently intervened not because he feared a miscarriage of justice , but because the Kremlin hierarchy recognized that a verdict exonerating Budanov would leave the army itself vulnerable .
critics would suggest that it had failed to control its men and might even have encouraged and abetted the savagery in Chechnya-of which the charges against Colonel Budanov are but a small part .
so only a guilty verdict would suffice , but it still had to be qualified with a finding of insanity .
after all , no army can be held accountable for the murderous actions of an insane man .
no ordinary psychiatrist , however , attested to Budanov &apos;s alleged insanity .
instead , he was evaluated by experts from Moscow &apos;s Serbsky Institute of Psychiatry , which became infamous in the Brezhnev era for treating dissent as a form of schizophrenia and subjecting &quot; patients &quot; like Vladimir Bukovsky to psychotropic drugs to help them recognize the glories of Soviet life .
the Serbsky team claimed that Colonel Budanov was temporarily insane at the time of the murder due to &quot; patriotic fervor . &quot;
as in the Dreyfus affair , Russia &apos;s army is increasingly a prisoner of its friends-die hard communists , Great Russian chauvinists , ranting nationalists , and all the other anti-reform and anti-democratic groups who make defense of military honor a rallying cry for their own dark causes .
indeed , the army &apos;s honor is now so firmly tied to finding Budanov both guiltyand insane that Russia finds itself on the brink of issuing a nakedly political verdict .
like the Dreyfus affair , so pathetic a distortion of law into propaganda will ultimately leave an even more profound sense of shame , one lasting generations after Budanov &apos;s supporters have lost all credibility .
a journalist visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently asked me why five out of six students he interviewed at King Saud University still believe that Al Qaida was not responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in America last year ?
dealing with this question is increasingly frustrating for me , because I have run out of plausible explanations .
I used to believe that denial of Saudi complicity in the attacks reflected our distress with what happened on that dark day .
I hoped that we would have the courage to overcome our perceived humiliation and start looking deep into our national psyche , asking the big question , &quot; Why did 15 of our young men attack America in so brutal a way ? &quot;
so far , we are no closer than we were after the attack to answering to this question , because we cannot even find the nerve to ask it .
had we been more confident and less full of bluster , we would have organized seminar after seminar to analyze what happened , to understand the reasons behind it , and to plan for a future without a similar tragedy .
after all , Osama bin Laden &apos;s hijacked planes not only attacked New York and Washington , they also attacked Islam as a faith and the values of tolerance and coexistence that it preaches .
but despite the enormity of what happened , we remain in denial .
we still cling to conspiracy theories even after bin Laden and his fellow conspirators bragged about their great &quot; achievement . &quot;
we continue to close our eyes to the fact that 19 young Muslim men decided to leave home , head for what they described as jihad , and became criminals .
it is past time to move forward .
we must admit that 15 Saudis helped perpetrate the attacks on America of last September 11th , and that hundreds of other Saudis were needlessly killed far away from home , in the mountains and villages of Afghanistan .
we must uncover why Taliban-ruled Afghanistan seemed such an attractive destination for a significant portion of Saudi youth in the years before September 11th .
Afghanistan was a country where Muslims were killing each other .
any Muslim knew that his duty in this case was to try to reconcile the combatants , not join the violence .
when Arabs , including Saudis , first fought in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s , their campaign was politically and religiously just .
Afghan Muslims were confronting foreign aggressors who sought to impose Soviet-style communism upon them .
the Mujahideen were overseen by responsible clerics , who gave a shining example to Saudi youth .
some of those young men remained in Afghanistan as Mujahideen entered Kabul to take part in the bitter infighting that led to the Taliban &apos;s rise .
others returned home and were welcomed as heroes .
were those young men who returned home then wiser than today &apos;s Saudi youth ?
what happened in the last ten years that allowed extremists to find so many eager followers ?
since September 11th we have busied ourselves counseling the Americans , pointing out where they went wrong , but no one is listening .
instead , we should be remedying our own deficiencies .
we should be trying to answer the question that the Americans have been asking us incessantly : why did young Saudi men take part in the attacks ?
we must answer this question not for the Americans &apos; sake , but for our own .
it is not enough to say that the hijackers--and , indeed , the many Saudis being held at Guantanamo Bay--represent a subset of duped youngsters and that the rest of Saudi youth are different .
that is true , of course , but the damage that this relatively small group inflicted was monumental .
it is far better to try and understand their motives .
in our attempts to defend and justify ourselves over the past year , we Saudis learned about the consequences of extremism at Waco , Texas and Oklahoma City .
we wrote about the Michigan Militia and other American radical extremists .
of course there is extremism in America--extremism as ugly as any that we have at home .
but the Americans studied and analyzed minutely the Waco and Oklahoma City incidents on their own .
the motives behind those attacks were examined in an effort to guarantee that such events would not recur .
we Saudis have failed to do the same .
the most pressing issue now is to ensure that our children are never influenced by extremist ideas like those that misled 15 of our countrymen into hijacking four planes that fine September day , piloting them , and us , straight into the jaws of hell .
did the bombings that rocked Riyadh shock the al-Saud royal family from its complacency at long last ?
this rude interruption to their majesties &apos; indolence by their subjects incited rage and fury and something else--fear .
of course , alarm bells have rung before in Saudi Arabia , but the ruling family remained in denial--deniability and repression being the political arts at which the al-Saud excel .
if the regime is to forge a survival strategy , it must now re-examine its foundations .
as ruling families go , the al-Saud are spectacularly numerous--there are perhaps as many 22,000 of them .
but vast bloodlines have not prevented hardening of the arteries .
indeed , the men now struggling to hold things together are the incapacitated King Fahd ( 84 years old ) , his half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah ( 79 years old ) , and his full brothers , Defence Minister Sultan ( 78 years old ) , and Interior Minister Naif ( 75 years old ) .
old men , unsurprisingly , find it hard to cope with the breakdown of the assumptions that have governed their entire lives .
perhaps the most shattering lost illusion is the fact that the bombings occurred in the heart of the al-Saud &apos;s home-base in the Najdi region , which indicates that the enemy within resides nearer to the throne than anyone suspected .
this recognition is particularly unsettling because the al-Saud have alienated every group except their own .
if some Najdi may now be mistrusted , where can the al-Saud turn ?
Saudi Arabia &apos;s population is divided into distinctive regional , tribal , and sectarian groups .
to the east , in the oil-rich province , are the Shia .
politically emboldened since the fall of Saddam &apos;s regime and the resurgence of their brethren in Iraq , the Shia wasted no time in petitioning Crown Prince Abdullah to end both their exclusion from Saudi politics and their demonization as heretics by the Wahhabi religious establishment .
their message to the rulers is that it will no longer suffice to identify being Saudi exclusively with being Wahhabi Najdi .
meanwhile , the Hijazis , who originate in Mecca and Medina , hold long-repressed resentments due to their humiliating partial inclusion in Saudi politics .
although the Hijazis , who are Sunnis but not Wahhabis , are not viewed as heretics , they are marginalized because the Islam they practice has Sufi leanings--and tolerant Sufiism is anathema to the austerely dogmatic Wahhabis .
educated Hijazis ask only for modest reforms .
yet even moderation is dismissed by the al-Saud .
the tribes of the Asir region , which have a mixed sense of identity due to their close ties to Yemeni tribes , feel alienated from both the political and the economic center .
the population of al-Jawf in the north has a similar sense of political and economic alienation .
despite long simmering feelings of resentment and dispossession , these `minorities &apos; remain moderate in their demands for reform .
their leaders want to rescue the state , not raze it .
they form the vast majority of people in Saudi Arabia , and have not yet embraced the uncompromising rage of Osama bin Laden &apos;s clones .
the challenge facing the al-Saud is to include at the heart of the political system the peoples they have shunned for decades .
unless they begin to do so , these peoples will drift into the camp of the fanatics--if not as active terrorists than as passive supporters , much as the Catholic community in Northern Ireland passively embraced IRA terrorism as a way to end their exclusion from political life in the province .
the danger in Saudi Arabia is that the IRA are no match for Muslim fundamentalists in their fanaticism .
for the regime to embrace peoples it has excluded , it must agree on inclusiveness--and the tolerance of non-Wahhabi forms of Islam--as a survival strategy and stick to it .
this is difficult because the ruling al-Saud are themselves divided .
Crown Prince Abdullah is far more disposed to reform than Prince Naif , the powerful Interior Minister , who clings to the old narrow system of repression .
the al-Saud will undoubtedly be ruthless in seeking out the individuals directly implicated in the terrorist bombings .
those captured face beheading in the traditional way .
the problem for the regime is that the springs that nourish fanaticism will not be dammed by such exemplary punishment .
some royals recognize this and know that a more thorough housecleaning is needed .
they realize that the al-Saud must choose : continue on the narrow path of repression and ethnic and religious intolerance , or adopt a more open and inclusive policy .
both choices are fraught with danger : open up , and they include people in Saudi public life hitherto considered unworthy for being either heretics ( the Shia ) or of impure blood ( the Hejazis ) or too primitive ( the border tribes ) .
remain closed , and they will find themselves hostage to the forces of intolerance that threaten the regime .
the al-Saud religious alliance with the Wahhabis and the latter &apos;s control of a rigid religious educational system must change . &quot; moderate &quot; elements among the population will support this change ( and the manhunt for terrorist fanatics ) if they secure inclusion in Saudi life .
Alexis de Tocqueville warned that the most dangerous time for any authoritarian regime is when it reforms .
the al-Saud have procrastinated so long that every choice they now face is risky .
inclusion is the less dangerous path .
it puts at risk only the ethnically narrow and religiously intolerant structure of the regime .
by contrast , the regime itself will be imperiled if it clings to its narrow base .
Madrid – “ Time and again in our Nation ’ s history , Americans have risen to meet – and to shape – moments of transition .
this must be one of those moments . ” So begins the National Security Strategy of the United States of America , presented before Congress on May 27 .
as with the politics pursued in the Obama administration ’ s 16 months of office – dialogue , international commitment , nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament – the document ’ s strength lies in the position that it takes .
the Security Strategy is a clear departure from that of its predecessor and offers a wider conception of what national security represents for US President Barack Obama .
in the face of the major challenges of our times , Obama has taken a stand with a comprehensive doctrine .
indeed , the Security Strategy is almost a “ National ” Strategy .
its thinking goes beyond the dominant , unilateral paradigm of its predecessor and includes a defense of international law .
this is particularly noteworthy , given that none of the great treaties to create an international criminal court and a permanent war-crimes tribunal was signed by the US during George W. Bush ’ s presidency .
Obama ’ s approach to security is broader as well , proposing the “ three Ds ” – defense , diplomacy , and development – as indivisible parts of a whole .
the military dimension of intervention abroad loses its privileged role , making way for the prevention of conflict and for peace-keeping and stabilization missions .
in the fight against terrorism , the Strategy abandons the predominantly military viewpoint underlying the war against terror , and embraces a more significant role for the intelligence services .
for the first time , precise reference is made to people liable to be a threat to US security .
the US is not waging a war against terrorism ; it is at “ war against a specific network , al Qaida , and its affiliates . ” In this war , information resources are particularly necessary .
in order to guarantee national security , the Strategy is categorical – without giving in to the temptation of isolationism – in admitting the strategic value of the example and the importance of doing one ’ s homework first .
Obama steers clear both of interventions for humanitarian purposes and of attempting to export democracy by force .
there is no better way of exporting the values of democracy than by strengthening the US internally .
thus , an economic policy that tackles America ’ s debt and deficit makes up the main portion of the Strategy .
backing competitive education , innovation , technology , energy , and a more efficient and accessible health-care system complements and reinforces Obama ’ s leadership approach of setting an example with one ’ s own policies .
an important example is removing the US prison at Guantánamo Bay from international limbo – one of his first initiatives as president .
this approach does not have unanimous support among international experts .
the two main criticisms – lack of strategic clarity and less emphasis on the classical concepts of power – point to America ’ s loss of influence , power , and leadership .
but these criticisms reflect an inability to contemplate the current nature of armed conflict , which no longer follows the classical logic of military victory or defeat .
the war in Afghanistan and the complex situation in Iraq have highlighted the importance of a comprehensive approach .
military action cannot be considered the only variable of success .
a successful strategy should use civilian means – incidentally a model advocated by the European Union .
we are faced with forging a new long-term policy that affects both states and societies .
that task requires patience and strategic perseverance .
change will not occur from one day to the next , but the results obtained in the end will be better and more enduring .
Obama maintains the idea of service to a historical mission for the US : the important job of guaranteeing global security .
but , unlike his White House predecessors , Obama ’ s National Security Strategy recognizes the value of partnerships ; attaches greater importance to the civilian dimension as opposed to the military ; and stresses the value of dialogue and the need to reinforce international institutions .
this is a good sign for a world with different power centers and interests , with resources and legitimacy remaining tied to the nation-state , but in which challenges ( climate change , armed conflicts , pandemics , and transnational crime ) are global and , therefore , require cooperation among states .
we are in a transition period : international interconnection is increasing , as the global economic crisis has shown , but the management tools and mechanisms to guarantee the smooth operation of governments are still not being shared .
Obama ’ s new National Security Strategy shows a political willingness to back an international order able to tackle these challenges .
the road ahead is not free of difficulties , but the Strategy represents a decisive step towards solving the challenges of the twenty-first century and preparing us for the world of tomorrow .
PALO ALTO – A group of multi-national European scientists has used gene-splicing techniques to create an extraordinary tomato .
it boasts a deep purple skin and flesh , and contains levels of antioxidants 200 % higher than unmodified tomatoes .
when fed to highly cancer-susceptible mice , the tomatoes significantly extended the mice ’ s lifespan .
these studies have received wide attention , but an equally momentous achievement of genetic modification has been largely ignored for almost a decade .
that innovation is “ Golden Rice , ” a collection of new rice varieties that is bio-fortified , or enriched , by genes that express beta-carotene , the precursor of vitamin A , which is converted in the body , as needed , to the active form .
most physicians in North America and Europe never see a single case of vitamin A deficiency in their professional lifetimes .
but the situation is very different in poor countries , where vitamin A deficiency is epidemic among the poor , whose diet is heavily dominated by rice ( which contains neither beta-carotene nor vitamin A ) or other carbohydrate-rich , vitamin-poor sources of calories .
in developing countries , 200-300 million children of preschool age are at risk of vitamin A deficiency , which can be devastating and even fatal .
it increases susceptibility to common childhood infections such as measles and diarrheal diseases , and is the single most important cause of childhood blindness in developing countries .
every year , about 500,000 children become blind as a result of vitamin A deficiency , and 70 % die within a year of losing their sight .
in theory , we could simply supplement children ’ s diets with vitamin A in capsules , or add it to some staple foodstuff , the way that we add iodine to table salt to prevent hypothyroidism and goiter .
unfortunately , neither the resources – hundreds of millions of dollars annually – nor the infrastructure for distribution are available .
Biotechnology offers a better , cheaper , and more feasible solution : golden Rice , which incorporates beta-carotene into the genetically altered rice grains .
the concept is simple .
although rice plants do not normally synthesize beta-carotene in the endosperm ( seeds ) , they do make it in the green portions of the plant .
by using gene-splicing techniques to introduce the two genes that express these enzymes , the pathway is restored and the rice grains accumulate therapeutic amounts of beta-carotene .
golden Rice offers the potential to make contributions to human health and welfare as monumental as the discovery and distribution of the Salk polio vaccine .
with wide use , it could save hundreds of thousands of lives every year and enhance the quality of life for millions more .
but one aspect of this shining story is tarnished .
Intransigent opposition by anti-science , anti-technology activists – Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth , and a few other groups – has spurred already risk-averse regulators to adopt an overly cautious approach that has stalled approvals .
there is absolutely nothing about Golden Rice that should require endless case-by-case reviews and bureaucratic dithering .
as the British journal Nature argued in 1992 , a broad scientific consensus holds that “ the same physical and biological laws govern the response of organisms modified by modern molecular and cellular methods and those produced by classical methods .... &#91; Therefore &#93; no conceptual distinction exists between genetic modification of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that modify DNA and transfer genes . ”
put another way , government regulation of field research with plants should focus on the traits that may be related to risk – invasiveness , weediness , toxicity , and so forth – rather than on whether one or another technique of genetic manipulation was used .
nine years after its creation , despite its vast potential to benefit humanity – and a negligible probability of harm to human health or the environment – Golden Rice remains hung up in regulatory red tape , with no end in sight .
( Cancer-preventing tomatoes , take notice . )
by contrast , plants constructed with less precise techniques such as hybridization or mutagenesis generally are subject to no government scrutiny or requirements ( or opposition from activists ) at all .
that applies even to the numerous new plant varieties that have resulted from “ wide crosses , ” hybridizations that move genes from one species or genus to another – across what used to be considered natural breeding boundaries .
Judith Rodin , the president of the Rockefeller Foundation , announced last October that her organization will provide funding to the International Rice Research Institute to shepherd Golden Rice through national regulatory approval processes in Bangladesh , India , Indonesia , and the Philippines .
this is good news , but what is really needed is a multi-faceted , aggressive reform of the regulatory process so that all new genetic constructions will have a chance to succeed .
in an April editorial in the journal Science , Nina Fedoroff , an eminent plant geneticist who serves as senior scientific advisor to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , wrote : “ A new Green Revolution demands a global commitment to creating a modern agricultural infrastructure everywhere , adequate investment in training and modern laboratory facilities , and progress toward simplified regulatory approaches that are responsive to accumulating evidence of safety .
the Golden Rice story makes it clear that we do not yet have the will and the wisdom to make that happen .
Belgrade : it is widely believed that if only Slobodan Milosevic were removed from power , Serbia would be set on a path of renewal .
but reality here is more complex and more troubling .
if Serbia is to avoid a humanitarian disaster this winter , all of its politicians must put ambition aside so that the country can begin to rebuild .
even before the disaster of Kosovo , Serbia was an economic basket case .
key economic reforms that transformed much of postcommunist Europe -- macro-economic stabilization , freeing prices and foreign trade , privatization -- were scorned in order to sustain an authoritarian regime .
instead of integrating Serbia into the international community and stopping the rot in the country &apos;s living standards , the regime opted to cow its people into submission through high inflation , a brutal black market economy , and tolerance of massive corruption .
NATO &apos;s bombing was the coup de grace for an economy dying on its feet .
so stark are conditions now that the very survival of the nation is at stake .
bomb damage has been estimated at $ 30 billion , triple this year &apos;s GDP .
industrial production will drop this year to one fifth of its value in 1989 , while GDP per capita will be only $ 975 , a third of its value ten years ago .
one out of every two people in Serbia are unemployed .
without international help , and if our country &quot; relies on our own resources &quot; to rebuild , which is the stated policy of the regime , it will take between 40 and 80 years for Serbia to return to the economic level it enjoyed when President Milosevic first took power a decade ago .
Serbia &apos;s people recognize that without reintegration into the world community reconstruction is impossible .
continued isolation will mean generations of misery .
the truth is that the regime knows this , too , but seems to want the nation to go down with it .
although the government realizes that there is no money for reconstruction at home and that its accounts abroad are frozen , it tries to buy time by declaring its intention to reform and cooperate with the world , and by using pathetic marketing ploys such as glamorous opening ceremonies for pontoon bridges ( one was washed away the next day ) , ferry-ports , and other quick-fix rebuilding jobs .
of course , everyone is aware that the incumbent government could not , even if it wished , cooperate with the world since not a single member of it can obtain a visa to travel .
all that the politicians indicted by the Hague War Crimes Tribunal may now do is run a prison economy , which is what they are doing .
Discontent is mounting . protests and rallies increase in size and frequency .
Serbia could witness one of two scenarios before year &apos;s end : ( 1 ) a spontaneous , large scale revolt whose outcome and consequences ( think of the bloodshed in Bucharest in December , 1989 or the Tien An Mien massacre ) are uncertain or ( 2 ) the peaceful demise of the Milosevic regime .
the second scenario envisions change through democratic elections .
but fair elections in Serbia are currently impossible , not only because the regime holds all the media cards and controls the election process , but because the country is in such ruin that no party program could realistically be disseminated .
in any case , elections could not be organized in time to avoid a humanitarian disaster this winter .
that is why Group 17 – an organization of leading economists and social scientists who aim to create in Serbia a market economy and open and democratic society under the rule of law – is proposing a &quot; Serbian Stability Pact &quot; as a peaceful and fast solution to end the crisis .
the &quot; Serbian Stability Pact &quot; is based on the judgement that all Serbia &apos;s political protagonists must take responsibility in the current crisis .
thus , the plan , calls for the following :
* A constitutional means to remove Mr. Milosevic from power , with the ruling party renouncing its executive power for a period of one year ;
* All opposition parties will renounce their aspirations to power for the same period and their leaders will refrain from joining transitional forms of government ;
* A transitional government of technocrats will be formed ( the most serious candidate to head this government is Dragoslav Avramovic , who enjoys wide popular support ) , its members pledging not to run in the elections to follow their one-year term , nor will this transitional government support any single political party that might run ;
* Radical economic reform .

since its creation on July 18th , the &quot; Serbian Stability Pact &quot; has gained the backing of opposition parties and groups , previously divided -- among them Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Party and Zoran Djinjic of the Allliance for Change -- as well as the strong support of the Serbian Orthodox Church , the only institution in Serbia with its credibility intact , it having condemned the crimes committed in Kosovo , the patriarch having called for the resignation of President Milosovic .
like the Roman Catholic Church in the years of Solidarity &apos;s struggle in the 1980s , the Serbian Orthodox Church is widely seen as a surrogate for our lost national identity .
its participation in the Stability Pact provides additional legitimacy and a guarantee for a peaceful transition .
on August 19th , many thousands of Serbs will gather in front of the Federal Parliament in Belgrade to demonstrate their determination to effect political change peacefully .
all the leading opposition parties , whose coming together seemed unlikely only a few weeks ago , will participate .
by rallying behind this domestic &quot; Stability Pact &quot; Serbia can proclaim its intention to make itself a viable candidate for partnership in implementing the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe that the leaders of the world community initiated in Sarajevo a few weeks ago .
in an incredibly short period of time the Serbian Stability Pact has united more political protagonists than any previous democratic movement in Serbia since the break-up of Yugoslavia .
our hope must be that , beginning on August 19th , the voice of reason will begin to prevail in Serbia , and that a transitional government can begin to rebuild the country in genuine freedom and democracy .
new YORK – After the Greek and Irish crises and the spread of financial contagion to Portugal , Spain , and possibly even Italy , the eurozone is now in a serious crisis .
there are three possible scenarios : “ muddle through , ” based on the current approach of “ lend and pray ” ; “ break-up , ” with disorderly debt restructurings and possible exit of weaker members ; and “ greater integration , ” implying some form of fiscal union .
the muddle-through scenario – with financing provided to member states in distress ( conditional on fiscal adjustment and structural reforms ) , in the hope that they are illiquid but solvent – is an unstable disequilibrium .
indeed , it could lead to the disorderly breakup scenario if institutional reforms and other policies leading to closer integration and restoration of growth in the eurozone ’ s periphery are not implemented soon .
the crisis started with too much private debt and leverage , which became public debt and deficits as crisis and recession triggered fiscal deterioration and private losses were mostly socialized via bailouts of financial systems .
then , distressed sovereigns that had already lost market access – Greece and Ireland – were bailed out by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union .
but no one will bail out these super-sovereigns if the sovereigns prove to be insolvent .
thus , the current strategy of kicking the can down the road will soon reach its limits , and a different plan will be needed to save the eurozone .
the first institutional reform takes the form of a larger envelope of official resources , which would mean a quasi-fiscal union .
official resources currently are sufficient to bail out Greece , Ireland , and Portugal , but not to prevent a self-fulfilling run on the short-term sovereign and financial liabilities of Spain and other potentially distressed eurozone members .
so , even if these countries were to implement the necessary fiscal and structural reforms , an increase of official resources would nonetheless be needed .
because nervous investors don ’ t want to be last in line in case of a run , a disorderly rush to the exits is likely when official resources are insufficient .
short of full fiscal unification – or a variant of it in the form of eurozone bonds – this increase in official resources would occur through a much-enlarged European Financial Stability Facility and a much greater commitment by the European Central Bank to long-term bond purchases and liquidity operations to support banks .
since quasi-fiscal union implies that the eurozone ’ s core economies could end up systematically bailing out those on the periphery , only a formal loss of fiscal sovereignty – a credible commitment by the peripheral countries to medium- and long-term fiscal discipline – could overcome the current political resistance of Germany and others .
but even a larger envelope of official resources is not sufficient to stem the insolvency problems of Greece , Ireland , and , possibly , Portugal and Spain .
thus , a second set of policies and institutional reforms requires that all unsecured creditors of banks and other financial institutions need to be “ treated ” – that is , they must accept losses ( or “ haircuts ” ) on their claims .
this is needed to prevent even more private debt being put on government balance sheets , causing a fiscal blowout .
if orderly treatment of unsecured senior creditors requires a new cross-border regime to close down insolvent European banks , such a regime should be implemented without delay .
similarly , super-sovereigns cannot continue to bail out distressed sovereigns that are insolvent rather than illiquid .
thus , in addition to an orderly resolution regime for banks , Europe must also implement early orderly restructurings of distressed sovereigns ’ public debt .
waiting until 2013 to implement these restructurings , as German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposes , will destroy confidence , as it implies a much larger haircut on residual private claims on sovereign borrowers .
thus , orderly market-based restructurings via exchange offers need to occur in 2011 .
such exchange offers can limit private creditors ’ losses if they are done early .
that way , formal haircuts on the face value of debt can be avoided via new bonds that include only a maturity extension and an interest-rate cap that is set below today ’ s unsustainable market rates .
waiting to restructure unsustainable debts would only lead to disorderly workouts and severe haircuts for some private creditors .
finally , Europe needs policies that restore competitiveness and growth to the eurozone ’ s periphery , where GDP is either still contracting ( Greece , Spain , and Ireland ) or barely growing ( Italy and Portugal ) .
without growth , it will be difficult to stabilize public and private debts and deficits as a share of GDP – the most important indicator of fiscal sustainability .
Moreover , without growth , the social and political backlash against painful belt-tightening will eventually undermine austerity and reform .
unfortunately , fiscal austerity and structural reforms are – at least in the short run – recessionary and deflationary .
so other policies are needed to restore growth .
the ECB should pursue a much looser monetary policy to jump-start growth , with a weaker euro to help boost the periphery ’ s competitiveness .
in addition , Germany should delay its fiscal consolidation ; if anything , it should cut taxes for a couple of years to boost its own growth and – via trade – that of the periphery .
in the next few months , it will become clear whether European policymakers can compromise and implement reforms that dampen the threat of a eurozone breakup .
either the EU moves in the direction of a more stable equilibrium of closer integration , or the risk of an unstable and disorderly breakup scenario will rise significantly .
new YORK – The global recession now underway is the result not only of a financial panic , but also of more basic uncertainty about the future direction of the world economy .
consumers are pulling back from home and automobile purchases not only because they have suffered a blow to their wealth with declining stock prices and housing values , but also because they don ’ t know where to turn .
should they risk buying a new car when gasoline prices might soar again ?
will they be able to put food on the table after this year ’ s terrifying rise in food prices ?
decisions about business investment are even starker .
businesses are reluctant to invest at a time when consumer demand is plummeting and they face unprecedented risk penalties on their borrowing costs .
they are also facing huge uncertainties .
what kinds of power plants will be acceptable in the future ?
will they be allowed to emit carbon dioxide as in the past ?
can the United States still afford a suburban lifestyle , with sprawling homes in far-flung communities that require long-distance automobile commutes ?
to a large extent , economic recovery will depend on a much clearer sense of the direction of future economic change .
that is largely the job of government .
after the confused and misguided leadership of the Bush administration , which failed to give any clear path to energy , health , climate , and financial policies , President-elect Barack Obama will have to start charting a course that defines the American economy ’ s future direction .
the US is not the only economy in this equation .
we need a global vision of sustainable recovery that includes leadership from China , India , Europe , Latin America , and , yes , even Africa , long marginalized from the world economy , but very much part of it now .
there are a few clear points amidst the large uncertainties and confusions .
first , the US cannot continue borrowing from the rest of the world as it has for the past eight years .
America ’ s net exports will have to increase , meaning that the net exports of China , Japan , and other surplus countries will consequently decrease .
the adjustments needed amount to a sizeable deficit-to-balance swing of around $ 700 billion in the US current account , or nearly 5 % of US GNP .
China ’ s trade surplus might shrink by half of that amount ( with cuts in trade surpluses also spread over other global regions ) , meaning a shift in Chinese GNP toward internal demand and away from net exports equal to between 5 % and 10 % of China ’ s GNP .
Fortunately , China is promoting a major domestic expansion .
second , the decline in US consumption should also be partly offset by a rise in US investment .
however , private business will not step up investment unless there is a clear policy direction for the economy .
Obama has emphasized the need for a “ green recovery , ” that is , one based on sustainable technologies , not merely on consumption spending .
the US auto industry should be re-tooled for low-carbon-emission automobiles , either plug-in hybrids or pure battery-operated vehicles .
either technology will depend on a national electricity grid that uses low-emission forms of power generation , such as wind , solar , nuclear , or coal-fired plants that capture and store the carbon-dioxide emissions .
all of these technologies will require public funding alongside private investment .
third , the US recovery will not be credible unless there is also a strategy for getting the government ’ s own finances back in order .
George W. Bush ’ s idea of economic policy was to cut taxes three times while boosting spending on war .
the result is a massive budget deficit , which will expand to gargantuan proportions in the coming year ( perhaps $ 1 trillion ) under the added weight of recession , bank bailouts , and short-term fiscal stimulus measures .
Obama will need to put forward a medium-term fiscal plan that restores government finances .
this will include ending the war in Iraq , raising taxes on the rich , and also gradually phasing in new consumption taxes .
the US currently collects the lowest ratio of taxes to national income among rich nations .
this will have to change .
fourth , the world ’ s poor regions need to be seen as investment opportunities , not as threats or places to ignore .
at a time when the major infrastructure companies of the US , Europe , and Japan will have serious excess capacity , the World Bank , the European Investment Bank , the US Export-Import Bank , the African Development Bank , and other public investment funds should be financing large-scale infrastructure spending in Africa , to build roads , power plants , ports , and telecommunications systems .
so long as the credits are long term and carry a modest interest rate ( say , 25-year dollar loans at 5 % per annum ) , the recipient countries could repay the loans out of the significant boost in incomes that would result over the course of a generation .
the benefits would be extraordinary , for both Africa and the rich countries , which would be putting their businesses and skilled workers back to work .
such loans , of course , would require a major global initiative , at a time when even blue-chip companies cannot borrow overnight , much less for 25 years !
in typical business cycles , countries are usually left to manage the recovery largely on their own .
this time we will need global cooperation .
recovery will require major shifts in trade imbalances , technologies , and public budgets .
these large-scale changes will have to be coordinated , at least informally if not tightly , among the major economies .
each should understand the basic directions of change that will be required at the national level and globally , and all nations must share in the deployment of new sustainable technologies and in the co-financing of global responsibilities , such as increased investments in African infrastructure .
we have arrived at a moment in history when cooperative global political leadership is more important than ever .
Fortunately , the US has taken a huge step forward with Obama ’ s election .
now to action .
new YORK – While the United States recently reported 3.5 % GDP growth in the third quarter , suggesting that the most severe recession since the Great Depression is over , the American economy is actually much weaker than official data suggest .
but official measures of GDP may grossly overstate growth in the economy as they don &apos;t capture the fact that business sentiment among small firms is abysmal and their output is still falling sharply .
third quarter GDP - properly corrected for these factors - may have been 2 % rather than 3.5 % .
the story of the US is , indeed , one of two economies . there is a smaller one that is slowly recovering and a larger one that is still in a deep and persistent downturn .
consider the following facts .
while America ’ s official unemployment rate is already 10.2 % , the figure jumps to a whopping 17.5 % when discouraged workers and partially employed workers are included .
and , while data from firms suggest that job losses in the last three months were about 600,000 , household surveys , which include self-employed workers and small entrepreneurs , suggest that those losses were above two million .
Moreover , the total effect on labor income – the product of jobs times hours worked times average hourly wages – has been more severe than that implied by the job losses alone , because many firms are cutting their workers ’ hours , placing them on furlough , or lowering their wages as a way to share the pain .
many of the lost jobs – in construction , finance , and outsourced manufacturing and services – are gone forever , and recent studies suggest that a quarter of US jobs can be fully outsourced over time to other countries .
thus , a growing proportion of the workforce – often below the radar screen of official statistics – is losing hope of finding gainful employment , while the unemployment rate ( especially for poor , unskilled workers ) will remain high for a much longer period of time than in previous recessions .
consider also the credit markets .
Prime borrowers with good credit scores and investment-grade firms are not experiencing a credit crunch at this point , as the former have access to mortgages and consumer credit while the latter have access to bond and equity markets .
but non-prime borrowers – about one-third of US households – do not have much access to mortgages and credit cards .
they live from paycheck to paycheck – often a shrinking paycheck , owing to the decline in hourly wages and hours worked .
and the credit crunch for non-investment-grade firms and smaller firms , which rely mostly on access to bank loans rather than capital markets , is still severe .
or consider bankruptcies and defaults by households and firms .
larger firms – even those with large debt problems – can refinance their excessive liabilities in court or out of court ; but an unprecedented number of small businesses are going bankrupt .
the same holds for households , with millions of weaker and poorer borrowers defaulting on mortgages , credit cards , auto loans , student loans , and other forms of consumer credit .
consider also what is happening to private consumption and retail sales .
recent monthly figures suggest a pick-up in retail sales .
but , because the official statistics capture mostly sales by larger retailers and exclude the fall in sales by hundreds of thousands of smaller stores and businesses that have failed , consumption looks better than it really is .
and , while higher-income and wealthier households have a buffer of savings to smooth consumption and avoid having to increase savings , most lower-income households must save more , as banks and other lenders cut back on home-equity loans and lower limits on credit cards .
as a result , the household savings rate has risen from zero to 4 % of disposable income .
but it must rise further , to 8 % , in order to reduce the high leverage of household sector .
to be sure , the US government is increasing its budget deficits to put a floor under demand .
but most state and local governments that have experienced a collapse in tax revenues must sharply retrench spending by firing policemen , teachers , and firefighters while also cutting welfare benefits and social services for the poor .
many state and local governments in poorer regions of the country are at risk of bankruptcy unless the federal government undertakes a massive bailout of their finances .
Moreover , income and wealth inequality is rising again : poorer households are at greater risk of unemployment , falling wages , or reductions in hours worked , all leading to lower labor income , whereas on Wall Street outrageous bonuses have returned with a vengeance .
with the stock market rising while home prices are still falling , the wealthy are becoming richer , while the middle class and the poor – whose main wealth is a home rather than equities – are becoming poorer and being saddled with an unsustainable debt burden .
so , while the US may technically be close to the end of a severe recession , most of America is facing a near-depression .
little wonder , then , that few Americans believe that what walks like a duck and quacks like a duck is actually the phoenix of recovery .
PALO ALTO – The United States and Europe are two giant free-trade areas , each wealthy but with serious short-run problems and immense long-run challenges .
they are also two single-currency areas : the dollar and , for much of Europe , the euro .
the challenges facing both are monumental .
but only Europe ’ s currency union faces uncertainty about its future ; America faces no existential crisis for its currency .
the two economic powers ’ similarities and differences , particularly with respect to internal labor mobility , productivity , and fiscal policies , suggest why – and provide clues about whether the eurozone can weather the crises on its periphery and evolve into a stable single-currency area .
labor mobility from poorer to richer areas provides a shock absorber against differential economic hardship .
the other natural shock absorber is a depreciating currency , which increases competitiveness in the area hit hardest .
that cannot happen with a common currency , and economic adjustment is doubly difficult when labor is not mobile enough to help mitigate regional contractions in income and unemployment .
the reasons for lower labor mobility in the eurozone than in America are legion .
true , America ’ s original thirteen colonies were a loose federation , and many Americans considered themselves citizens of their state first and of the US second as late as a century after the Revolution .
but one ’ s state was not a fully formed nation , with its own shared and deeply ingrained history , culture , ethnic identity , and religion .
perhaps the most important cultural component of labor mobility is language .
from Mississippi to Maine , and from New York to New Orleans , America ’ s written language is the same and the spoken language is understandable to all .
not so from Berlin to Barcelona or Rome to Rotterdam .
( or , for that matter , from northern to southern China or in multilingual India , where Hindi is spoken by only 42 % of the population . )
for eurozone citizens who do not speak a major language , especially English , mobility across national borders within the single-currency area is limited at best .
these are differences that cannot be easily erased .
while some aspects of culture are becoming globalized , variation across borders in Europe is far greater than it is between US states .
for example , until the second half of the twentieth century , today ’ s eurozone members regularly slaughtered each other on centuries of battlefields .
by contrast , history is more commonly shared among Americans from different states , who , other than in the Civil War , have fought side by side in the nation ’ s external wars .
all of this means that when California slumps , residents simply leave for the mountain states ; when manufacturing jobs disappear in the upper Midwest , people migrate to new jobs in Texas .
that pattern is much less prevalent in Europe .
Moreover , it is a pattern that has closed the gap ( now roughly 40 % ) between per capita income in America ’ s poorest and richest states , as labor and capital continually adjust by moving to areas where productivity is higher .
the range of productivity and per capita income within the eurozone is considerably wider , making mobility even more important .
finally , while fiscal systems differ among American states , the overall fiscal burden is under half that of the federal level .
almost all states ’ constitutions require balanced budgets ( with exceptions for emergencies ) .
American states and municipalities do face serious medium- and long-term fiscal challenges from underfunded pension and health-care systems , but citizens living in different states have a common national budget , whereas citizens of different eurozone countries face radically different central-government fiscal positions .
indeed , many observers argue that the eurozone ’ s lack of a common fiscal system is its main problem .
but competition over taxes and services is beneficial , not harmful .
nevertheless , much tighter constraints , with serious and enforceable penalties , must be placed on permissible budget positions and their transparency if the euro is to survive .
and it can survive .
those who would write off the euro as a failure should consider that it is only ten years old .
America , too , historically had problems as a single-currency area , from early chaos before the Constitution to the clash between agricultural and banking interests over the gold standard in the late nineteenth century .
while the euro faces strong headwinds , the dollar ’ s early sailing wasn ’ t always smooth , either .
the eurozone countries must first deal with the sovereign-debt crisis , reduce their fiscal deficits , and strengthen the woefully undercapitalized banking system .
but , if the eurozone is to survive and prosper beyond the current crisis , it will also need comprehensive structural reforms to boost internal labor mobility and defuse the pressures caused by economic adjustment among nations and regions .
whether citizens will support politicians who propose the labor , tax , and other reforms needed to enhance mobility , and whether such reforms will be sufficient to overcome linguistic and cultural barriers , are open questions .
successive generations of post-war European political leaders initiated the European Union and then currency union in order to knit countries so closely together that another major war between them would become impossible .
whether monetary union was necessary to accomplish that aim is debatable .
despite the considerable advantages of a common currency ( price transparency , lower transaction costs , and inflation credibility , to name a few ) , the difficulty of macroeconomic management of such diverse economies looms larger than ever .
the euro was always a big gamble , a grand experiment .
historical efforts at monetary union have sometimes collapsed , and sometimes they have survived multiple crises .
the future of the eurozone may be cloudy , but it will not be dull .
London – Individual elections do not always enhance democracy – a useful reminder that the ballot box is only one part , albeit a central one , in any free , plural society .
of course , there are also magnificent examples of elections that strengthen both the stability and the institutions of a community .
we have just witnessed an example of the second kind in India , the world ’ s largest and greatest democracy , where 420 million voters there returned a Congress-led government with a solid majority .
it was in many respects a personal triumph for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
his victory shows that it is possible to succeed in politics through decency , honesty , and high intelligence .
Sonia Gandhi and her family should also take credit for putting at the forefront of their campaign a vision of an inclusive society , which rejects divisions on the basis of caste , ethnicity , language , and religion .
the result should help India to continue – not without occasional turbulence – its journey toward becoming a high-growth economy that raises the standard and quality of life for the poor .
I wish we could look forward in Europe to a similarly healthy democratic experience next month when voters throughout the European Union elect new members of the European Parliament .
since 1979 , these MEPs have been elected direct rather than indirectly from national parliaments .
but turnout for these elections has been falling in several countries .
there is a danger that the number voting in June will be lower than ever before .
Moreover , in the current grim economic conditions across Europe , voters who do turn out are all too likely to take the opportunity to punish the major parties and vote for fringe and even extremist politicians .
there are particular circumstances that may encourage this electoral response .
first , everywhere there is a sense of disgust at the way the recent boom seemed to privatize gains while the subsequent bust socialized losses .
a few rich individuals appeared to gain and all taxpayers to lose .
this has spread a sense of unfairness .
second , globalization has been the target for populist criticism .
it is usually defined to mean everything we dislike – from changes to our traditional way of life to loss of jobs .
it is a brave politician who points out how much liberalizing trade and opening up markets have increased our overall prosperity .
third , in Britain at least , the entire political class has been discredited by a sleazy scandal about the expenses that many parliamentarians have paid themselves .
analogies with pigs , snouts , and troughs fill the pages of British newspapers .
but there is another reason for the lack of interest in the EU elections .
the European Parliament has power , but it deals with issues that , while important to voters , do not top their list of concerns .
the EU ’ s member states retain power over the most sensitive political issues , including taxes , health , education , pensions , the labor market , and foreign policy .
so the questions that dominate national campaigns have little impact on European elections .
the European Parliament deals with the important areas where individual countries have pooled their sovereignty , like trade , the creation of a pan-European market , and the biggest environmental issues .
but these are not often the questions that trigger the most passionate interest .
in addition , the European Parliament ’ s detachment from national political debates means that it has less political legitimacy than is desirable .
indeed , those who worry about the creation of a European superstate can rest easy .
there will be no such entity , because there is no European electorate ; the electorate remains French , Belgian , Latvian , Greek , and so on .
they all vote at the same time , for the same institution .
but what does an Italian know – or care , for that matter – about British politics ?
look at our television programs .
we know far more about Europe ’ s football than we do about Europe ’ s politics . “ The beautiful game ” brings people together more effectively and reliably than the European Parliament is able to do .
that is no criticism of those who work – often very hard – in the European Parliament .
we have created a political body that has power to hold European institutions to account but has no obvious European electorate to which it can itself be held accountable .
a parliament without a people inevitably increases the sense of frustration that many European voters feel about the process of making Europe-wide policy choices in their name .
if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified later this year , one of the changes should result in national parliaments becoming more involved in European decision-making .
but we need to look country-by-country at what else we can do to tie Europe ’ s own parliament into national politics .
unless we do that better , fewer people will vote for MEPs , more of them will be elected simply on a protest vote and represent Europe ’ s murky extremes , and the whole practice and principle of European democracy will be discredited .
Bangkok – The thunderous results of Thailand ’ s general election on July 3 will seem familiar to anyone attuned to the political upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa .
entrenched incumbent regimes everywhere are under severe stress from advances in information technology , shifts in demographics , rising expectations , and the obsolescence of Cold War exigencies .
in the absence of a willingness and ability to use violent repression , regime survival can be achieved only through concessions , accommodation , and periodic reinvention .
with 47 million voters and turnout at 75 % , Thailand ’ s latest election results pose a decisive challenge to the country ’ s long-established regime .
the Pheu Thai party , led by Yingluck Shinawatra , the youngest sister of exiled fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , secured a resounding triumph , winning 265 seats in the 500-member assembly , while the ruling Democrat Party mustered just 159 .
the return to power of Pheu Thai is extraordinary – and not only because Yingluck will be Thailand ’ s first female prime minister .
the establishment-aligned courts dissolved the party ’ s two previous governments , and banned scores of its leading politicians from office for five years .
Pheu Thai ’ s victory thus suggests that a previously marginalized electorate has been permanently awakened .
a similar majority of the Thai electorate voted for Thaksin ’ s parties and their pro-poor populist platforms in January 2001 , February 2005 , April 2006 , and December 2007 , defying a military coup , a coup-induced constitution , judicial interventions , and army coercion and repression .
the recent election marked a profound break from the past .
in the second half of the twentieth century , Thai elections seemed to alternate with military coups .
voters were bought and sold like commodities .
after elections , voters hardly ever saw or heard from their MPs , who typically went on to engage in corruption and graft in Bangkok – eventually losing legitimacy and paving the way for military coups .
a new constitution and elections invariably ensued .
this vicious cycle of coups , constitutions , and elections defined Thai politics for decades .
that pattern reflected Cold War imperatives .
the pillars of the Thai state – nation , religion , and the king – struck a unifying , collective chord , and the resulting stability enabled economic development .
while growth was so concentrated that popular resentment simmered , communism was kept at bay .
challenges to the established order , with the military-monarchy-bureaucracy triumvirate as its anchor , were repeatedly put down .
back then , Thai schoolchildren sang martial songs each morning , and Thais knew their place in the rigidly elitist pecking order , which was reinforced by socialization and indoctrination in classrooms and living rooms , where only state-controlled media could enter .
Thais were more like obedient subjects than informed citizens .
Dissenting views found little traction .
the rise of Thaksin ’ s Thai Rak Thai party in 2001 changed all that .
the party pursued a scientific approach to elections , relied on expensive polling by foreign experts , and offered a clear agenda and strong leadership .
it was the first post-Cold War party to capture Thais ’ collective imagination .
the voices of neglected swaths of the electorate , particularly in the rural north and northeast of the country , began to count .
Vote-buying became increasingly insufficient .
a bond between party and voters – a bond based on policy – took root .
by 2001 , the Cold War was long over .
political leaders who dissented from the status quo could no longer easily be jailed on communism-related charges .
the advent of the Internet had made it harder for the authorities to shape Thai minds , as media sources multiplied and the resulting diffusion of information undermined the effectiveness of state propaganda .
Moreover , new international norms had come to the fore : external powers that previously turned a blind eye to coups , military dictatorships , and repression now rallied around democracy and human rights .
Thailand ’ s demographics also changed .
the Cold War curriculum of induced unity and stability has no relevance for today ’ s schoolchildren ; indeed , most university students nowadays were born after the Cold War ended .
these factors fostered a new political environment , and Thaksin , who was a telecommunications tycoon at the time , was well positioned to seize the opportunity .
he overhauled the bureaucracy , delivered on his promises to the poor , mapped out an industrial strategy , and re-designed an overstretched foreign policy agenda , among other innovative measures .
of course , Thaksin ’ s rule had a dark underside : corruption , legislated conflicts of interest , cronyism , human rights violations , and abuse of power , among other evidence of misrule .
such is Thaksin ’ s mixed legacy .
the opportunities , hopes , and dreams delivered to the downtrodden and the vision and plans for Thailand ’ s future were enmeshed with his own venality .
but , while Thaksin committed many infractions , his gravest “ sin ” was to have changed the way Thais think and behave .
some see this change as usurpation ; others view it as Thailand ’ s deliverance into the twenty-first century .
Thaksin ’ s adversaries in Thailand ’ s entrenched regime were unwilling to accede to his policy innovations and populism .
for them , doing so would be tantamount to admitting that most people in this hospitable , well-endowed kingdom had been kept poor by design all along .
for his part , Thaksin has sought to portray the recent election results as being all about him .
but he is best viewed as a self-serving , unwitting agent of political modernization .
it is these twenty-first-century dynamics and changes , underpinned by an increasingly assertive citizenry , with which the Thai establishment must come to terms if the country is to move forward .
there is something tragic about Europe &apos;s current development .
democracy &apos;s march across the continent , and the formation of a single market across much of Europe , have created unprecedented stability , security , and prosperity .
the new single currency , the euro , and the European Union &apos;s promise to admit as many as ten new members in 2004 , are powerful indicators of ongoing integration .
yet , the ability of European institutions to accommodate deeper and broader integration is increasingly undermined by the persistence of a contradictory and long-obsolete ideal : the nation-state as the basis of political legitimacy and sovereignty .
it is largely because the idea of common European citizenship is often understood by analogy to that of national citizenship that further European integration engenders so much fear and opposition .
the nation-state in the traditional sense presupposed a citizenry that was created as competing collective identities decayed .
Venetians became Italians , Bavarians became Germans , and so on .
Nation-builders throughout Europe promoted - with varying degrees of success , to be sure - the emergence of a dominant culture , an official language , and an identity based partly on distinctions vis-à-vis neighboring states , peoples and cultures .
national minorities everywhere faced expulsion or enormous official pressure to assimilate .
a European nation-state in this sense was untenable even for the original six members of the European Community - all of them highly industrialized countries with similar social and political traditions and institutions .
it is no more feasible today for the EU &apos;s 15 members , and further enlargement means that the multitude of collective identities , cultures , languages , religions , and worldviews will become greater still .
the singular &quot; people &quot; that defines citizenship in a traditional nation-state could be forged only by plunging Europe into appalling repression and war lasting generations , if not centuries .
of course , European integration has been driven from the outset precisely by the shared historical memory of the terrible suffering wrought by aggressive nationalism .
but without an alternative to the nation-state as the basis of citizenship , the legitimacy and effectiveness of EU institutions have come under growing strain .
witness , for example , Ireland &apos;s veto of the institutional reforms adopted at the EU &apos;s Nice summit in December 2000 - reforms without which enlargement cannot go forward .
similarly , opinion polls show that support for EU membership has fallen rapidly even in many candidate countries .
political leaders such as Vaclav Klaus in the Czech Republic and Viktor Orban in Hungary welcome the common market , but argue that their nation-states did not re-gain theirde facto sovereignty from Moscow only to surrender itde jure to Brussels .
yet free movement of goods and services , labor , capital , and ideas ( the single market &apos;s &quot; four freedoms &quot; ) makes irrelevant much of what traditional European nation-states do - namely , defending these freedoms within a smaller territory .
with the EU &apos;s internal borders reduced to purely administrative boundaries , this task has passed to institutions that wield immense preemptive authority over member states .
an alternative must therefore be found to a definition of citizenship that regards these institutions as merely some sort of formalized representation of member states &apos; common political will .
what should an alternative conception of European citizenship look like ?
the US model of political identity , shaped by a legacy of immigration and voluntary cultural integration , cannot be simply transposed to Europe , where distinct traditions , cultures , and attitudes are so deeply entrenched .
but a conception of citizenship that isbasic and minimal is essential where a Pole and a Swede may fall in love while studying in Spain , begin their careers in Germany , and settle down to raise a family in Italy .
common citizenship does not require a common form of life , common existential values or a common historical past .
indeed , this is theonly democraticand stable definition of European citizenship , because it alone is capable of eliciting the consent and allegiance of every individual .
clearly , people in the real world do not ordinarily get to choose the basic structure of their society .
but imagine , in the spirit of the philosopher John Rawls &apos;s famous thought experiment in his bookA Theory of Justice , that youdo get to choose the rules - although without knowing who you will be in such a hypothetical society .
assuming that you are rational , you must calculate that you may be a member of a cultural minority .
obviously , you will not choose rules that define citizenship in terms of a particular cultural identity .
on the contrary , you will seek to hedge your bets by ensuring that citizenship is constituted by individual rights of participation in collective projects , backed up by a legal system that guarantees these rights .
citizenship in this sense views political sovereignty and legitimacy as features of institutions that fostervoluntary social cooperation by embodying rules of interaction that are viewed as fair and efficient from the perspective of everyone .
if repression were enough to secure compliance with the rules , democratic legitimacy would be unimportant .
as the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe demonstrates , repression alone is a poor guarantee of stability .
European citizenship understood in this way is compatible with a multitude of collective identities ranging from family or friendship groups to professional associations and corporations , regionally defined communities , and shared cultural , political and religious affinities .
such a conception stabilizes social cooperation within Europe because it reflects a basic normative consensus on the design of institutions and thus orients individual behavior toward preserving these institutions .
in fact , a well-developed conception of democratic citizenship will always emphasize individual rights .
citizenship is not constituted by groups , but by individuals interactingas citizenswith specific interests and goals .
this means that they pursue their interests and goals within commonly accepted rules of interaction including , naturally , rules of conflict resolution between different collective identities .
London – This is a tough time to be a decision-maker .
we live in an era of low predictability .
the world appears in constant flux .
the challenges are immense .
and most of all , there is , in many instances a clash between the correct short term politics and the correct long term policy .
on the economy , the climate debate and security , the immediate pressures pretty much run one way : increase the role of government in the economy ; put the climate deal off to more congenial financial times ; and get out of substantial military commitment to fighting global terrorism .
yet in each case the right long-term policy almost certainly points to the opposite course .
what is the way to bridge this gap between short and long term ?
to decide how to do that is to decide fundamentally what we believe in and what we want from our future.In deciding this , only the head can guide us in how to do it ; but the heart must tell us what it is we truly believe in doing .
in the economy , the near universal conventional wisdom after the collapse of the banking system , was that the market had failed and the state had to step in .
old copies of John Kenneth Galbraith ’ sThe Great Crash of 1929 and Keynesian tracts were dusted off and avidly re-read .
and it is true : the market did fail and the state had to step in .
the fiscal and monetary stimuli were important in themselves , but even more so because they indicated that the strength of government was going to be utilised to prevent contagion and further collapse .
but if we move to analysing what sort of recovery we can expect and what sort of future economy we are trying to fashion , it is by no means clear that we need a continuing , intrusive state role .
on the contrary , we need the private sector to regain its sense of enterprise , innovation and vigour ; we need to be careful of regulating so as to squeeze the availability of credit ; and we should certainly avoid protectionism .
true , the private sector will have much re-structuring to go through and the big deficits have been accumulated in the crisis must be unwound.This will mean a radical re-structuring of the state and its services .
but in the end , business not government will power the global economy forward .
in other words , the claim that “ the market failed ” is too alarmingly broad.Actually , one part of the market failed , but government and regulators were part of that failure .
if we believe that this is true , it will ultimately be the creativity ( in the best sense ) of the private sector that will see us return to prosperity .
so we need to make decisions in the coming weeks and months which help the private sector and not harm it .
likewise , in respect of the environment and energy , whatever the financial pressures , if we think that the earth ’ s climate is probably changing as a result of human activity , we need to set the global economy on a low carbon path to the future .
this doesn ’ t mean that we can come out with unrealistic propositions as we struggle for a new global treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol .
we should not make the best the enemy of the good .
there are major things we can do on the basis of existing knowledge – on deforestation , energy efficiency and renewables – to make a big difference over the next decade .
we will then require a long-term framework of incentives to develop the technologies of the future .
but the point is : now is not the time to put off action .
the seriousness of China on this issue , and now India , the enthusiasm of Brazil and others in the emerging markets to participate in tackling climate change : all of this offers a huge opportunity that should be grasped .
and for the West , we should all remind ourselves about $ 100 a barrel oil .
there are exemplary reasons of energy security why we need to change the nature of our economies to drive down carbon dependence .
in security questions , the choices here are perhaps the hardest of all .
a public , understandably disheartened by the length of the current military campaigns and loss of life in Afghanistan and Iraq , is sympathetic to the idea of disengagement .
but this is also where , most of all , we need to decide what it is we truly believe in .
the reason it is hard going in Afghanistan right now , for example , is that the forces we are facing are making it so .
they are doing this by the use of terrorism and by brutal intimidation of the civilian population and in defiance of the expressed and plain will of the international community .
time and again what is clear is that people , given the chance , do want governments that are accountable , proper rule of law and the ability to choose their own destiny .
those using terror , whether in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq , Somalia , Yemen and the list could go on and on , do so to de-stabilise nations and to thwart the will of the people to live in peace .
Disengaging now will not leave people free from our interference ; it will put them at the mercy of groups whose extremism threatens the very way of life that we stand for and to which they aspire .
so no matter how difficult it is , we should remember what it is we believe in and why .
so now is a moment , even amongst all the uncertainty , for some clarity and that clarity comes best from a worked out strategy based on a strong set of convictions .
any good international investment banker knows that the end of April is a bad time to come peddling his services , for that is when the world ’ s finance ministers return home from the IMF meetings in Washington , chastened that risks to the global economy could spill over into their own backyards .
ministers are too busy recovering from their trauma to think about paying fat fees for big new international bond issues .
who wants to build up debt if there might be a financial crisis around the corner ?
better to keep socking away US Treasury bills , even if the return is far lower than on most other investments .
or is it ?
with today ’ s global economy in the middle of a sustained and increasingly balanced expansion , has the time come to start considering upside risks ?
in particular , should governments , especially those that are endlessly building up dollar reserves , instead start thinking about how to build up their roads , bridges , ports , electric grids , and other infrastructure ?
has the time come to start laying the groundwork to sustain future growth , especially in poorer regions that have not yet shared in today ’ s prosperity ?
don ’ t get me wrong , I am not arguing for fiscal profligacy .
but the balance of risks has shifted over the past few years .
yes , within the next three to five years , there will probably be another global recession .
and , yes , there will probably be another rash of financial crises – perhaps in Central Europe , which now looks like Asia did before its 1997 crisis .
recent jitters about Iceland ’ s gaping trade deficit and Brazil ’ s new finance minister rippled around the world , reminding global investors that while many emerging markets are gradually moving towards investment-grade status , most are not there yet .
but the risks are two-sided , and sound economic policy is just as much about capitalizing on good times as avoiding bad ones .
economic gurus at places like the World Bank have developed a ridiculously long list of steps that countries should take to raise their growth rates ( the so-called “ extended Washington Consensus ” ) .
like maintaining good health , it is not enough to concentrate on a single component .
but if there is one area where obvious opportunities exist , and where policy can really make a difference , it would have to be infrastructure investment .
India ’ s infrastructure problems are legendary , with airports and railroads that are comically inadequate .
however , aside from a few countries – including China , of course , but also Spain – low infrastructure spending is epidemic .
even the United States has infrastructure that is hobbled by neglect , with collapsing bridges and a dangerously overburdened electrical grid .
Land-rich Brazil , too , is a case study in the consequences of under-investment .
its infrastructure systems might be adequate to support the country ’ s tepid 3-4 % growth rates , but they are hardly adequate to support the 6-7 % rates that it ought to be enjoying amidst the current global boom .
Russia , despite Siberia ’ s massive oil and gas riches , isn ’ t even investing enough to support healthy growth in its energy industries , much less human development in the country ’ s impoverished areas ( including hapless Siberia ) .
true , government infrastructure spending is often wasted .
my hometown of Boston recently managed to spend an astounding $ 15 billion dollars to move a few highways underground .
and that so-called “ Big Dig ” looks like a model of efficiency next to many of Japan ’ s infamous bridges to nowhere .
but there are ways to waste less .
transparency in procurement works wonders .
so , too , does private sector involvement .
the Nobel laureate economist William Vickrey argued tirelessly in favor of privately financed toll roads .
private oversight can often produce better and more efficient construction , and , in theory , toll roads help alleviate traffic congestion .
( ironically , Vickery died while sitting in a traffic jam . )
even China , which has added more than 50,000 kilometers of roads and dozens of airports over the past five years , makes use of private financing .
true , countries that have not cleaned up their fiscal act , such as India , must not recklessly plunge ahead with big government projects without counterbalancing reforms to ensure sustainability .
fiscal prudence and stable inflation rates are cornerstones of today ’ s relatively healthy global economic environment .
but for countries that have scope to invest more , particularly those that are holding a surfeit of precious development dollars in idle US Treasury bills , the time may be ripe to reassess the balance of risks .
the IMF is absolutely right to remind ministers each April of downside risks .
countries ’ need for better infrastructure is no license to throw prudence out the window .
but when the world ’ s finance ministers recover from their April shock therapy , they also need to look at the opportunities .
new YORK – The upcoming G-20 meeting is a make-or-break event .
unless it introduces practical measures to support the countries at the periphery of the global financial system , global markets will suffer another round of decline , just as they did after United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’ s failure in February to produce practical measures to recapitalize America ’ s banking system .
the current financial crisis is different from all the others we have experienced since World War II .
on previous occasions , whenever the financial system came to the brink of a breakdown , the authorities got their act together and pulled it back from the brink .
this time the system actually broke down in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers ’ collapse last September , and it had to be put on artificial life support .
among other measures , both Europe and the US have effectively guaranteed that no other important financial institution will be allowed to fail .
this step was necessary , but it produced unintended adverse consequences : many other countries , from Eastern Europe to Latin America , Africa , and Southeast Asia , could not offer similarly convincing guarantees .
abetted by the determination of national financial authorities at the center of the world economy to protect their own institutions , capital fled from the periphery .
currencies fell , interest rates rose , and credit default swaps soared .
when the history of this crisis is written , it will be recorded that – in contrast to the Great Depression – protectionism first prevailed in finance rather than trade .
the International Financial Institutions ( IFIs ) are now faced with a novel task : to protect the periphery countries from a storm that emanated from the center .
they are used to dealing with governments ; now they must learn to deal with the collapse of the private sector .
if they fail to do so , the periphery economies will suffer even more than those at the center .
countries on the periphery tend to be poorer and more dependent on commodities than the more developed world , and they must repay more than $ 1.4 trillion in bank loans in 2009 alone . these loans cannot be rolled over without international assistance .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown recognized the problem and placed it on the G-20 ’ s agenda .
but , in the course of preparations , profound attitudinal differences have surfaced , particularly between the US and Germany .
the US has recognized that only using the credit of the state to the fullest extent possible can reverse the collapse of credit in the private sector .
Germany , traumatized by the memory of hyperinflation in the 1920 ’ s and the consequent rise of Hitler in the 1930 ’ s , is reluctant to sow the seeds of future inflation by incurring too much debt .
both positions are firmly held and can be buttressed by arguments that are valid from the point of view of the country concerned .
but the controversy threatens to disrupt the April 2 meeting .
it should be possible for each side to respect the other ’ s position without abandoning its ownand to find common ground .
instead of setting a universal target of 2 % of GDP for stimulus packages , it is enough to agree that the periphery countries need international assistance to protect their financial systems and engage in countercyclical policies .
that is in the common interest .
if the periphery economies are allowed to collapse , developed countries will also be hurt .
as things stand now , the G-20 meeting will produce some concrete results : the resources of the International Monetary Fund are likely to be effectively doubled , mainly by using the mechanism of the New Arrangement to Borrow ( NAB ) , which can be activated without resolving the vexing question of reapportioning voting rights in the IFIs .
this will be sufficient to enable the IMF to come to the aid of specific countries in trouble , but it will not provide a systemic solution without conditionality .
such a solution is readily available in the form of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) .
the mechanism exists and has already been used on a small scale .
SDRs are highly complicated and difficult to grasp , but they boil down to the international creation of money .
countries that are in a position to create their own money do not need them , but the periphery countries do .
rich countries should therefore lend their allocations to the countries in need .
this would not create a budget deficit for rich countries .
recipient countries would have to pay the IMF a very low interest rate : the composite average treasury bill rate of all convertible currencies .
they would have free use of their own allocations , but the IFIs would supervise how the borrowed allocations are used to ensure that the borrowed funds are well spent .
it is difficult to think of a scheme where the cost / benefit ratio is so favorable .
in addition to the one-time increase in the IMF ’ s resources , there ought to be substantial annual SDR issues , say , $ 250 billion , as long as the global recession lasts .
to make the scheme counter-cyclical , the SDR issues could be callable in tranches when the global economy overheats .
it is too late to agree on issuing SDRs at the upcoming G-20 meeting , but if it were proposed by President Barack Obama and endorsed in principle by the majority of participants , it would be sufficient to give heart to the markets and make the meeting a resounding success .
Cambridge – The world economy enters 2009 with more uncertainty ( and anxiety ) than at any time in recent memory .
although the financial crisis appears to be contained in the United States and Europe , its full repercussions will not be clear for some time .
the advanced countries are in for the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression .
but how long and deep will this recession be , and how badly will it affect emerging and developing nations ?
we don ’ t have the answers to these questions , in part because the consequences will depend on what actions policymakers take .
the right responses will ensure that the world economy can begin to recover by late 2009 .
poor policy choices , on the other hand , will at best delay recovery and at worst do permanent damage .
here is a list of things to watch for .
will the US response be “ bold ” enough ?
Barack Obama has promised that it will be , echoing at least part of Franklin D. Roosevelt ’ s famous call for “ bold , persistent experimentation ” at the height of the Great Depression in 1932 .
Obama has a first-rate group of economists on his side , which ensures that he will not do anything silly .
but America ’ s circumstances are sufficiently exceptional that he will need advisers who are willing to try new , untested ideas – in other words , experimentation à la FDR .
in particular , he will need to go beyond Keynesian fiscal-stimulus policies to heal the deep wounds to economic confidence that lie at the root of the current crisis .
so far , confidence-building measures have been limited to financial markets , through public guarantees , liquidity support , and capital injections .
but workers who worry about being laid off are unlikely to go spend , regardless of how much money fiscal stimulus puts in their pockets .
just as banks are hoarding cash , households will try to preserve wealth by increasing their saving .
so incentives targeted directly at preserving employment will have to be part of the solution .
will Europe get its act together ?
this could have been Europe ’ s moment .
after all , the crisis originated in the US and left American policy focused on its domestic troubles , opening up room for global leadership by others .
instead , the crisis demonstrated the deep divisions within Europe – on everything from financial regulation to the requisite policy response .
Germany has dragged its feet on fiscal stimulus , stymieing what should have been the second leg of a globally coordinated fiscal action plan .
if Europe wants to pull its weight on the global stage , it will have to act with greater unity of purpose and shoulder a greater share of responsibility .
Alas , the best that can be hoped for at this stage is that Europe will not undermine the global fiscal stimulus that even the International Monetary Fund , the guardian of fiscal orthodoxy , regards as absolutely essential .
will China hold together ?
even though a weak US response is the biggest risk on the economic side , what happens in China may well have deeper and more lasting consequences on the broader historical canvas .
for China is a country of enormous hidden tensions and cleavages , and these may erupt into open conflict in difficult economic times .
experts on China differ on the rate of economic growth needed to create employment for the millions of Chinese who flock into the country ’ s cities every year .
but it is virtually certain that China will fall short of this threshold in 2009 .
this explains the almost continuous stream of measures that emanate from Beijing these days : increased public spending , monetary easing , pressure on state enterprises to expand activity , subsidies to exporters , partial convertibility of the remninbi to spur trade with neighboring countries , and so on .
but will this do enough to stem the slowdown in an economy that has become hooked on external demand in recent years ?
if social tensions rise , China ’ s government is likely to respond with greater repression , which will bode ill both for its relations with the West and for its medium-term political stability .
experience shows that democracies hold the edge over authoritarian regimes when it comes to handling the fallout from crises .
it was democratic India ( in 1991 ) and South Korea ( in 1997-1998 ) that turned around their economies quickly , while Pinochet ’ s Chile ( in 1983 ) and Suharto ’ s Indonesia ( in 1997-98 ) fell into deeper quagmires .
authoritarian regimes lack the institutions of conflict management that democracies provide .
so tensions spill over into the streets and take the form of riots and protests .
however the Chinese leadership responds , future generations may remember 2009 less for its global economic and financial crisis than for the momentous transformation that it caused in China .
will there be enough global economic cooperation ?
when domestic needs become paramount , global economic cooperation suffers .
but the costs of protectionism in trade and finance are especially large at moments like these .
the Great Depression was aggravated by the trade barriers that countries imposed to protect domestic employment .
this will be a temptation this time around as well .
and banks – whether explicitly nationalized or not – will be under pressure to prioritize domestic borrowers .
so far , the IMF has reacted with newfound vigor , establishing a much-needed short-term lending facility , which may well need to be expanded if emerging markets come under greater pressure .
the World Trade Organization , meanwhile , has wasted valuable time on the irrelevant Doha round .
it should have focused its efforts on monitoring and implementing the G-20 ’ s commitment not to raise trade barriers .
policymakers need to shed received wisdom and forget useless dichotomies such as “ markets versus government ” or “ nation-state versus globalization . ”
they need to come to grips with the reality that national regulations and international markets are inextricably linked with – and in need of – each other .
the more pragmatically and creatively they act , the more quickly the world economy will recover .
BERKELEY – The central insight of macroeconomics is a fact that was known to John Stuart Mill in the first third of the nineteenth century : there can be a large gap between supply and demand for pretty much all currently produced goods and services and types of labor if there is an equally large excess demand for financial assets .
and this fundamental fact is a source of big trouble .
a normal gap between supply and demand for some subset of currently produced commodities is not a serious problem , because it is balanced by excess demand for other currently produced commodities .
as industries suffering from insufficient demand shed workers , industries benefiting from surplus demand hire them .
the economy rapidly rebalances itself and thus returns to full employment – and does so with a configuration of employment and production that is better adapted to current consumer preferences .
by contrast , a gap between supply and demand when the corresponding excess demand is for financial assets is a recipe for economic meltdown .
there is , after all , no easy way that unemployed workers can start producing the assets – money and bonds that not only are rated investment-grade , but really are – that financial markets are not adequately supplying .
the flow of workers out of employment exceeds the flow back into employment .
and , as employment and incomes drop , spending on currently produced commodities drops further , and the economy spirals down into depression .
thus , the first principle of macroeconomic policy is that because only the government can create the investment-grade financial assets that are in short supply in a depression , it is the government ’ s task to do so .
the government must ensure that the money supply matches the full-employment level of money demand , and that the supply of safe savings vehicles in which investors can park their wealth also meets demand .
how well have the world ’ s governments performed this task over the past three years ?
in East Asia ( minus Japan ) , governments appear to have been doing rather well .
Shortage of demand for currently produced goods and services and mass unemployment no longer loom as the region ’ s biggest macroeconomic problems .
flooding their economies with liquidity , maintaining export-friendly exchange rates , and spending to employ workers directly and boost the supply of safe savings vehicles have made the Great Recession in East Asia less dire than it has been elsewhere .
in North America , governments appear to have muddled through .
they have not provided enough bank guarantees , forced enough mortgage renegotiations , increased spending enough , or financed enough employment to rebalance financial markets , return asset prices to normal configurations , and facilitate a rapid return to full employment .
but unemployment has not climbed far above 10 % , either .
the most serious problems right now are in Europe .
uncertainty about how , exactly , the liabilities of highly leveraged banks and over-leveraged peripheral governments are to be guaranteed is shrinking the supply of safe savings vehicles at a time when macroeconomic rebalancing calls for it to be rising .
and the rapid reductions in budget deficits that European governments are now pledged to undertake can only increase the likelihood of a full double-dip recession .
the broad pattern is clear : the more that governments have worried about enabling future moral hazard by excessive bailouts and sought to stem the rise in public debt , the worse their countries ’ economies have performed .
the more that they have focused on policies to put people back to work in the short run , the better their economies have done .
this pattern would not have surprised nineteenth-century economists like Mill or Walter Bagehot , who understood the financial-sector origins of industrial depression .
but it does seem to surprise not only a great many observers today , but also a large number of policymakers .
in May , the world will mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe .
but instead of happily preparing for that occasion , the Baltic countries of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania – which scarcely 15 years ago regained the independence they lost in WWII – are uneasy .
the heads of state of all three countries have been invited to participate in the parades to be held in Moscow to celebrate the Red Army ’ s victory over Nazi Germany .
but the host of the celebration , Russia , in the guise of the Soviet Union , itself caused the war – the bloodiest in European history – whose end is being commemorated .
of course , the USSR instigated the war in tandem with Adolf Hitler , but its responsibility is undeniable .
by holding these celebrations in Red Square , and thus highlighting the Soviet victory , today ’ s Russia is also celebrating its gains in that war .
one of those gains was my country , Lithuania , whose incorporation into Stalin ’ s empire was accompanied by countless tragedies .
unlike Germany , Russia has never recognized its responsibility for the war and the mass graves of the innocent .
thus , a former captive nation is now being invited to celebrate its captivity .
this is why almost all Lithuanians – indeed , most residents of the Baltic countries – feel queasy at the prospect of their leaders marking this anniversary in Moscow .
but Estonians , Latvians , and Lithuanians are not the only Europeans who should feel this way .
when Stalin offered Hitler his friendship in the spring of 1939 – formally concluded that summer in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact – Nazi aggression was assured of not being knifed in the back from the East and so was left with free hands to do as Hitler pleased in the West .
the Pact came after the pogroms of “ Kristallnacht ” in Germany , so its Soviet initiators knew pretty well to what destiny they were consigning the Jews of Poland and Lithuania , which , in accord with the first secret Protocol signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov on August 23 , 1939 , were to go to Hitler .
a month later , in equal secrecy , Hitler sold Lithuania to Stalin .
the other countries situated between Germany and the USSR were similarly sentenced to disappear as nations – sooner or later .
their peoples were treated practically as though they did not exist ; the aggressors ’ only concern was territory .
the death sentences and torturing that were then imposed on almost entire nations and millions of people are , it now appears , to be silently accepted and noisily celebrated on May 9 in Moscow .
some Russian officials want to unveil a monument Stalin to crown the festivities .
when Hitler ’ s Wehrmacht struck West , the USSR duly supported Germany in its war against Poland , France , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Denmark , Norway , and the United Kingdom .
as a result , cities in those countries were flattened and people killed not only by the Nazis , but also by their Soviet ally , which invaded Poland and supplied the Wehrmacht with the material it needed for its war against the West .
in return , Stalin ’ s USSR was given a free hand to attack Finland and to occupy Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , as well as a part of Romania .
in law , when two criminals seal a contract with the blood of their victims , that act remains a crime , even if the two criminals later have a falling out and spray bullets at one another .
the same applies to the two greatest European criminals of the twentieth century .
we must not forget the crimes that Hitler and Stalin committed together as de facto allies only because they later turned on each other .
the blood of WWII ’ s victims calls for justice and fairness , but most of all it demands honesty about who and what caused their tragic fate .
if those who gather in Moscow on May 9 do anything to validate Soviet war crimes , they will show themselves insensitive to the silent cries of WWII ’ s tens of millions of dead innocents .
the only real winner would be the spirit of that evil .
over the past decade , the global economy has achieved unprecedented prosperity built on trade , international capital flows , and technological innovation .
amidst this undeniable progress , however , remain widespread poverty , disease , and illiteracy .
in a world made smaller by modern telecommunications , satellite TV , and the Internet , the vast challenges of development that we continue to face confront us everyday .
perhaps no individual has done more to raise the alarm – earning deserved credit for many successes and understanding all too clearly the remaining shortcomings – than James Wolfensohn , the outgoing President of the World Bank .
as Managing Director of the IMF , I have had the privilege of working closely with Jim Wolfensohn , seeing up close a man with an extraordinary mission : the sustainable reduction of global poverty .
Wolfensohn left a successful business career to lead the global campaign against poverty .
it is perhaps the ultimate tribute to his commitment and tenacity that his efforts over the past 10 years have attracted criticism as well as praise , for he has stood at the center of every major campaign aimed at alleviating the economic ills of our generation .
Wolfensohn led the World Bank onto the cutting edge of every important development debate , and was at the forefront of the effort to combat HIV / AIDS , as well as other deadly diseases that threaten so many impoverished countries .
he has been a forthright spokesman for women ’ s rights and a champion of environmental concerns , as well as a formidable advocate in arguing for debt reduction for the most heavily indebted nations .
he also has placed the World Bank at the center of the effort to help rebuild nations emerging from devastating civil conflict , from Bosnia to Sierra Leone to East Timor .
as World Bank president , Wolfensohn argued consistently that the world cannot be divided into “ haves ” and “ have-nots . ”
poverty anywhere means poverty everywhere , and equitable growth is needed for the stability and security of all .
indeed , that is the true meaning of globalization .
at the same time , Wolfensohn made a big contribution to development work by arguing that poverty must be treated as a multidimensional problem .
it is now widely accepted that financial assistance alone will not bring about effective poverty reduction .
rather , sustainable , pro-poor growth is the key , requiring political stability – that is , peace and security for individuals – good governance , and ownership of policies by all stakeholders .
under Wolfensohn , the World Bank followed through on this comprehensive and coordinated approach in a concrete fashion , making significant inroads into global poverty .
in the last 10 years , the Bank was the largest external financier of primary education , basic health care , HIV / AIDS programs , and programs aimed at protecting the environment and biodiversity .
this agenda goes to the heart of improving human dignity and maintaining sustainable development .
Wolfensohn ’ s insistence that corruption be confronted as part of the development process was another valuable step forward .
it used to be that even mentioning corruption in some official circles was considered taboo .
but corruption poses the single largest obstacle to growth and development in many countries , especially as it diverts resources from the poor .
the World Bank insisted that corruption be seen as a cancer , and that fighting it be made synonymous with fighting poverty .
indeed , outspokenness was a hallmark of Wolfensohn ’ s tenure .
many a government minister , Bank officer and NGO representative has experienced his blunt criticism , as well as his effusive praise .
the IMF has not been immune to this treatment . the strength of the Bretton Woods institutions lies in intellectual diversity , and the Fund benefited from Wolfensohn ’ s honesty , as well as from his commitment to Bank-Fund cooperation , which progressively deepened during the past decade .
the work of our two institutions — in areas as diverse as poverty reduction strategies , debt relief , and the unheralded joint program to analyze financial sectors in our member countries — strengthened the global economy .
ultimately , development is about people .
Jim Wolfensohn ’ s greatest strength has been his genuine caring for the world ’ s poor .
his legacy will include a World Bank that is firmly committed to a world free of poverty .
the poor around the world may feel poorer from losing him as their champion and advocate .
in fact , their prospects are brighter because of his work over the past decade .
when is a free-trade agreement bad ?
when the treaty &apos;s underlying purpose is neither about trade nor freedom .
such a pact - calling for a &quot; united economic space &quot; - is now being entered into by Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Belarus .
on the surface , a &quot; united economic space &quot; sounds like something to applaud .
but , sadly , the treaty will only entrench postcommunism &apos;s corrupt and criminal business practices , not increase trade or prosperity .
a huge benefit for the accession countries in preparing themselves to join the EU was that they were forced to conform to European business , political , and legal norms .
the proposed &quot; united economic space &quot; will also have its own norms - the ways of the oligarch , the corrupt bureaucrat , the crony capitalist , and the politically motivated prosecutor .
does anyone doubt that the jailing of Mikhail Khodorkovsky , chairman of Yukos oil , is politically motivated ?
I myself have endured numerous politically inspired investigations and prosecutions of my former business as a means to drive me out of politics .
can anyone imagine such a prosecution occurring in the EU ?
that Mr. Khodorkovsky is spending months in jail before he is formally charged tells us much about the nature of business , politics , and law in the nations of the former Soviet Union .
in the countries of the &quot; united economic space , &quot; the rule of law typically means , &quot; I rule , and I am the law . &quot; so , instead of promoting growth , the &quot; united economic space &quot; will retard it by discouraging competition and investment .
instead of enhancing European stability , it will undermine it by dividing Europe into the EU &apos;s single market and an economic trading area ruled by arbitrary fiat and decree .
but , as a matter of economic principle , practical diplomacy , and visionary politics , aren &apos;t regional free-trade areas at least a step in the right direction ?
after all , countries that scrap tariffs among themselves trade more and often raise their economic grow rates as a result .
Moreover , free-trade agreements are typically seen as politically valuable : countries tied by commerce are supposedly less likely to shoot at each other .
unfortunately , the &quot; united economic space &quot; promises no such benefits .
by definition , it discriminates against countries outside the club , with which trade will not be liberalized .
members will specialize in industries in which they lack comparative advantage , undercutting the main reason to support free trade in the first place .
worse yet , markets will be carved up for political , not commercial , reasons , locking in inefficiencies .
the &quot; political &quot; argument - that regional trade bodies promote peaceful foreign relations - is simply wrongheaded in the post-Soviet case .
after all , Ukraine managed to eliminate its nuclear weapons and reach accommodation over the Black Sea fleet without joining a private economic bloc with Russia .
on the other hand , not long after the &quot; united economic space &quot; was announced , Russia began to cast covetous eyes on the Ukrainian Black Sea island of Tuszla .
economic borders cannot and will not disappear until Russia and Ukraine agree on their territorial borders .
because the proposed members of this new &quot; united economic space &quot; share Russian as alingua franca and a common past within the USSR , outsiders may dismiss too readily subtler differences in culture , outlook , and even vocabulary .
because the region shares many outward forms of European culture , it is a short step to assuming that recent moves to free-markets and democracy will be seamless and permanent .
but the &quot; united economic space &quot; is also a perversion because the presence of Belarus and Kazakstan will ensure that democracy remains low on the agenda .
another perversion of democracy is the fact that the supra-national body that is to administer the &quot; united economic space &quot; grants Ukraine and its 49 million people only 9.9 % of votes , while it gives Russia and its 140 million people 83 % .
that gross imbalance in representation is a shameful betrayal of Ukraine &apos;s sovereignty .
it is a deal that can only have been agreed to as the price of Russian support for Ukraine &apos;s President Leonid Kuchma as he desperately seeks to extend his presidency beyond the two-term limit that he faces this year .
my opposition to the &quot; united economic space &quot; is not opposition to Russia .
the more Ukraine trades abroad , the better ; if more of that open trade goes Russia &apos;s way , so be it .
but that trade should reflect Ukraine &apos;s competing with the world , unconstrained by a private deal that excludes outsiders and their demands for a stable and predictable legal environment and the best business practices .
I am not one of those people who think Russia is so naturally collectivist that free trade and an open economy cannot work there .
nor do I believe that Russia is so inherently autocratic that democracy must invariably fail .
but I do believe that , for these canards to be discarded , Russia and Ukraine must open themselves to global competition , not isolate themselves with each other .
Dmitri Likhachev , one of Russia &apos;s most respected intellectuals in the communist era , said that there is no such thing as the Russian soul ; &quot; we can create whatever future we want . &quot;
Ukraine and Russia , too , can create the future they want , but not by closing themselves off in a &quot; united economic space &quot; that , in reality , is nothing more than another dark corner .
Italy may have defeated France to win the World Cup , but the real winner was the “ Old Europe ” that Donald Rumsfeld once derided .
after all , who would have predicted a World Cup final between France and Italy ?
it looks as if the national teams of the two “ sick men of Europe , ” felt obliged to change their countries ’ images in the world .
in the Italian case , following the corruption scandals that have nearly sunk Il Calcio , Italy ’ s premier football league , the national team had to rehabilitate the game in the eyes of their fellow citizens .
more globally , however , it is as if “ Old Europe ” had decided that it was time to set the record straight and prove more dynamic than the world ’ s emerging forces .
indeed , in the new global balance , where football has become much more than sport , Europe is back with a vengeance .
what has been unfolding in front of our eyes in the last four weeks has been a modern and reduced version of the balance-of-power system that dominated Europe and the world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .
if football and its culminating moment , the World Cup , has become the universal religion of the global age , this is above all because it fulfills , in a non-spiritual way , contradictory instincts in human nature .
football magnifies the cult of the individual and the glorification of the hero , but it is also a celebration of the cooperative team spirit .
more than any other collective activity , it channels the search for identity and identification that dominates our age .
thanks to the World Cup , one is a citizen of the world , enjoying a spectacle together with billions of others on “ Planet Soccer . ”
even in Washington , where I arrived at the beginning of the tournament , I was greeted at the airport by television screens showing the game .
the program was in English , but the advertisements were in Spanish .
in terms of football at least , the Hispanic community ’ s influence has brought the United States closer to Europe ( though not , of course , in its team ’ s performance on the pitch ) .
at the same time , during the World Cup , fans are not only universal ; they are also unique , and they can express their difference with impunity , sometimes in the most assertive , aggressive , and , unfortunately , occasionally racist manner .
in a world of “ multiple identities , ” to choose one ’ s team is in part to decide who one is .
from this standpoint , this year ’ s World Cup has not only witnessed the triumph of European nations – all semi-finalists were European for the first time since 1982 – but also the absence of even a glimmer of European emotions .
in my country , France , most supporters were clearly motivated more by post-colonial references than by European allegiance .
African teams , except when they were playing against France , were favored over those from the European Union .
as I watched the Croatia-Australia match early in the tournament , I surprised myself , too , as I realized that my emotions were with the Australian team , whatever that could mean , given that there were so many Croatians playing for Australia .
this deep search for identification should not be confused with a simple surge of nationalism .
reality is more complex .
and this is not only because many coaches of the national teams are , like in the good old days , “ foreign mercenaries , ” with this Cup ’ s Swiss guards including the Brazilian coaches of Japan and Portugal , the Swedish coach of England , and the French coach of Tunisia .
the Cup ’ s explosions of proud nationalism hide more tortured realities .
nostalgia is not what it used to be .
in 1998 , when France won the Cup for the first time , the three colors of the French flag ( blue , white , and red ) were celebrated alongside with the three colors ( “ black , white , andbeur , the skin color of North Africans born in France to immigrant parents ) of the members of the French team .
but that innocence has been lost because it is no longer possible to celebrate the triumph of the French model of integration .
indeed , after the violent episodes of the last year , France ’ s immigrant communities have a very different message to deliver : “ Without us , you would not have had this World Cup success .
do you believe you can continue to ostracize the communities from which your soccer heroes come ? ”
from ping-pong diplomacy with China to the united German Olympic team that competed in 1990 before actual reunification , sport has prefigured political developments , and politicians everywhere have seized on the importance of the World Cup .
football success has become part of countries ’ “ soft power . ”
France may not have the military might of the US or the growth rate of China and India , but its team reached the World Cup championship , raising its standing in the eyes of billions of people – and perhaps giving a reprieve to its unpopular government .
but sport can also become a kind of gigantic , distracting screen behind which nasty regimes do outrageous things – the very opposite of the Olympic and World Cup spirit .
as the world was watching the football games in Germany , North Korea was testing long-range missiles and Palestinians in the governing Hamas launched attacks on Israel that prompted a bloody invasion of Gaza .
the World Cup is drama , excitement , a dream , but it is also a form of “ global escapism . ”
football may explain the world , but it does not improve it .
and now we are back to reality .
for the past several weeks , attention was focused on the war in Iraq and on the fault lines within Europe that the conflict exposed .
but at the same time--perhaps because no one was looking--a critical breakthrough occurred in the Convention for the Future of Europe , where the European Union &apos;s new constitution is being framed .
representatives of 16 countries--Austria , Ireland , Portugal , the three Scandinavian countries , and the ten states that will join the EU in May 2004--submitted a proposal , in the form of a declaration , that calls for preserving the EU &apos;s current delicate institutional balance .
they recommend retaining the European Commission as the proto-executive branch , the European Council to speak for national interests , and the European Parliament as the institution that represents Europe &apos;s citizens directly .
they reaffirm member states &apos; equality by defending the Council &apos;s rotating presidency .
but , in addition to avoiding destructive changes , the proposal suggests a way forward for the Convention .
specifically , it recommends a way to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Commission by allowing its president to be elected either by the Parliament or by an electoral college that also includes representatives from national parliaments .
this proposal is far superior to its predecessors .
Germany and France have proposed a system with two elected presidents--a Council president elected by its members and a Commission president elected by the European Parliament .
this is a strikingly bad idea .
creating a two-headed executive of this sort would guarantee continuous clashes between the two power centers .
the &quot; Gang of 16 &quot; is absolutely right that the EU should have a single president , not two .
in a world of internal and external security threats , the EU will need a stronger executive capable of reacting quickly to unfolding events .
if the Council presidency continues to rotate , then the logical entity to vest with executive authority is the president of the Commission .
but currently the president of the Commission is remote and inadequately accountable to his ultimate constituents .
fundamental political reform is needed .
unfortunately , the proposal fails to choose between the two alternatives for reform that it presents : election of the Commission president by the European Parliament or by an electoral college that also includes representatives from national parliaments .
at first sight , these two options may seem similar .
they are not .
the first alternative would steer the EU toward a parliamentary form of government , with the European Parliament entitled to both appoint and remove the Commission through a confidence vote .
the electoral college method , however , could be a first step toward a presidential form of government .
the path to a parliamentary model is more familiar in Europe , and at first it may appear safer .
but in the long run it could become very slippery .
given Europe &apos;s political heterogeneity , the European Parliament is unlikely to be ruled by a single-party majority .
a European Commission accountable to a divided European Parliament would thus be bogged down by the usual inefficiencies of coalition governments .
by contrast , a European Commission that is directly elected would have great legitimacy , as well as being insulated from political fights inside the European Parliament , thereby increasing its political effectiveness .
the main problem is that a directly elected Commission President might be premature : Europe may not be ready for such a radical change .
this is why the electoral college idea is so important : it allows for a gradual transition towards a regime that is desirable in the long run .
an electoral college would allocate seats to each country in proportion to its population , and each candidate would receive electoral college votes proportional to the vote taken in that country , either by universal suffrage or in the national parliament .
this would force presidential candidates to campaign with equal energy in all countries .
even better , the power to select the members of the electoral college should be given to national parliaments alone .
national parliaments have more legitimacy , attracting far higher voter turnout than elections to the European Parliament .
Europe would be brought closer to its citizens and national parliaments would gain a direct voice in EU decision making .
but delegates to the Convention should not stop there .
countries should be given the option of allocating their electoral college votes via either universal suffrage or a vote in the national parliament .
the system could evolve toward one of direct election without having to amend the constitution .
ultimately , the President of the Commission would be accountable directly to voters .
this is how the US gradually evolved into a presidential democracy , towards the mid-19th century .
delegates to the Convention should keep in mind the provision of the Socratic Oath that reminds physicians , &quot; First do no harm . &quot;
beyond that , they can do genuine good by recognizing the merit of the proposal for an electoral college .
in 1947 Palestinian Arabs and their allies rejected a UN proposal to partition Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state , just as ten years before they rejected a similar partitioning proposed by the Peel Commission .
more recently , both at Camp David and at Taba in Egypt , Arab negotiators again rejected proposals that would have led to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel .
apparently , many Palestinian Arabs , and much of the Arab world , continue to think that they can do better than a two-state solution .
after decades of conflict , it seems that the Arabs have not given up their goal of making all of Palestine into an Arab state .
true , Arab leaders differ over tactics .
from time to time Arab negotiators enter into discussions about the mundane issues that prospective neighboring states would need to resolve , such as political boundaries , security arrangements , and economic relations .
it is possible that at some point the Arabs will agree among themselves that the creation of a Palestinian state that claims to be committed to peaceful coexistence with Israel will be a useful tactic .
American and European governments seem willing to use the carrot of economic aid to encourage this development , in the way that the US pays off Egypt and Jordan to acquiesce in the existence of Israel .
but , unless the Arabs reconcile themselves to the permanent reality of a Jewish state in Palestine , the creation of a Palestinian Arab state will not provide more than the temporary palliative of a tenuous truce between Arabs and Jews .
the Zionist project of creating a Jewish state in Palestine entails a return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland , a land in which Jews lived since biblical times and which the Diaspora never abandoned .
whether or not this historical justification for Israel &apos;s creation is convincing , the important fact is that the Palestinian Arabs and their allies do not buy it .
Arabs express their disdain for Zionism by equating the Zionist project to the creation of a colony , to which millions of Jewish settlers have come .
according to this equation the conflict between Jews and Arabs replicates the conflicts between colonial settlers and indigenous peoples .
if the Arabs believe their own argument that Zionism is colonialism , with themselves as the victims , then , whether or not anybody else accepts this view , the lessons that the Arabs glean from colonial experiences become relevant to prospects for peace between Arabs and Israelis .
over the years Israeli governments encouraged Arabs to participate in Israel &apos;s economy .
this policy , which Israelis view to be benevolent , supposes that economic integration of Arabs and Jews is possible without modifying the Zionist concept of Israel as a Jewish state .
but , from the Arab perspective this policy reinforces their equating of Zionism to colonialism .
Arab rhetoric often takes the colonial experiences of Algeria and South Africa as models for their conflict with Zionism .
these analogies are important because in both Algeria and South Africa , colonialism failed .
descendants of the European settlers in Algeria fled back to Europe .
in South Africa , Blacks achieved political dominance over the descendants of British and Afrikaner settlers , large numbers of whom remain as a tolerated minority .
a permanent end to the conflict over Palestine will not be possible until the Palestinian Arabs and their allies become convinced that the failure of colonialism in countries like Algeria and South Africa is not a relevant lesson for them .
in other words Arabs will have to become convinced that they can neither subjugate the Jews nor drive the Jews out of Palestine .
the negotiating formula of &quot; land for peace &quot; and &quot; breakthroughs &quot; like the Oslo accords failed to dampen the conflict because the Arabs understandably interpret Israeli concessions as signs of weakness .
unfortunately , the Israelis can show the Arabs that they cannot destroy Israel only by enduring the violent war of attrition that the Arabs are pursuing .
Moreover , there seems no obvious way to speed up the process of convincing the Arabs that Israel is here to stay except by making this war of attrition as costly as possible for them .
but suppose a two-state solution were achieved in the not-too-remote future .
in thinking about this possibility we are drawn to the example of Ireland , where a two-state solution has worked .
having secured an independent Irish state , Catholics in the Republic of Ireland came to accept the existence of a settler enclave in Northern Ireland .
but , the Irish story has not had a happy ending .
the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland , whose position seems similar to that of the million Arabs who are Israeli citizens , eventually revolted against the dominant Protestants , with decades of violence resulting .
even if a Palestinian state committed to peaceful coexistence were created , down the road Israel may be unable to avoid the fate of Northern Ireland .
MELBOURNE – Scholars have long dreamed of a universal library containing everything that has ever been written .
then , in 2004 , Google announced that it would begin digitally scanning all the books held by five major research libraries .
suddenly , the library of utopia seemed within reach .
indeed , a digital universal library would be even better than any earlier thinker could have imagined , because every work would be available to everyone , everywhere , at all times .
and the library could include not only books and articles , but also paintings , music , films , and every other form of creative expression that can be captured in digital form .
but Google ’ s plan had a catch .
most of the works held by those research libraries are still in copyright .
Google said that it would scan the entire book , irrespective of its copyright status , but that users searching for something in copyrighted books would be shown only a snippet .
this , it argued , was “ fair use ” – and thus permitted under copyright laws in the same way that one may quote a sentence or two from a book for the purpose of a review or discussion .
publishers and authors disagreed , and some sued Google for breach of copyright , eventually agreeing to settle their claim in exchange for a share of Google ’ s revenue . last month , in a Manhattan court , Judge Denny Chin rejected that proposed settlement , in part because it would have given Google a de facto monopoly over the digital versions of so-called “ orphan ” books – that is , books that are still in copyright , but no longer in print , and whose copyright ownership is difficult to determine .
Chin held that the United States Congress , not a court , was the appropriate body to decide who should be entrusted with guardianship over orphan books , and on what terms .
he was surely right , at least in so far as we are considering matters within US jurisdiction .
these are large and important issues that affect not only authors , publishers , and Google , but anyone with an interest in the diffusion and availability of knowledge and culture .
so , while Chin ’ s decision is a temporary setback on the way to a universal library , it provides an opportunity to reconsider how the dream can best be realized .
the central issue is this : how can we make books and articles – not just snippets , but entire works – available to everyone , while preserving the rights of the works ’ creators ?
to answer that , of course , we need to decide what those rights are .
just as inventors are given patents so that they can profit from their inventions for a limited time , so , too , authors were originally given copyright for a relatively short period – in the US , it was initially only 14 years from the first publication of the work .
for most authors , that would be enough time to earn the bulk of the income that they would ever receive from their writings ; after that , the works would be in the public domain .
but corporations build fortunes on copyright , and repeatedly pushed Congress to extend it , to the point that in the US it now lasts for 70 years after the creator ’ s death .
( the 1998 legislation responsible for the last extension was nicknamed the “ Mickey Mouse Protection Act ” because it allowed the Walt Disney Company to retain copyright of its famous cartoon character . )
it is because copyright lasts so long that as many as three-quarters of all library books are “ orphaned . ”
this vast collection of knowledge , culture , and literary achievement is inaccessible to most people .
Digitizing it would make it available to anyone with Internet access .
as Peter Brantley , Director of Technology for the California Digital Library , has put it : “ We have a moral imperative to reach out to our library shelves , grab the material that is orphaned , and set it on top of scanners . ”
Robert Darnton , Director of the Harvard University Library , has proposed an alternative to Google ’ s plans : a digital public library , funded by a coalition of foundations , working in tandem with a coalition of research libraries .
Darnton ’ s plan falls short of a universal library , because works in print and in copyright would be excluded ; but he believes that Congress might grant a non-commercial public library the right to digitize orphan books .
that would be a huge step in the right direction , but we should not give up the dream of a universal digital public library .
after all , books still in print are likely to be the ones that contain the most up-to-date information , and the ones that people most want to read .
many European countries , as well as Australia , Canada , Israel , and New Zealand , have adopted legislation that creates a “ public lending right ” – that is , the government recognizes that enabling hundreds of people to read a single copy of a book provides a public good , but that doing so is likely to reduce sales of the book .
the universal public library could be allowed to digitize even works that are in print and in copyright , in exchange for fees paid to the publisher and author based on the number of times the digital version is read .
if we can put a man on the Moon and sequence the human genome , we should be able to devise something close to a universal digital public library .
at that point , we will face another moral imperative , one that will be even more difficult to fulfill : expanding Internet access beyond the less than 30 % of the world ’ s population that currently has it .
new YORK – The most important contribution of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 60 years ago , on December 10 , 1948 , was to assert a powerful idea : rights are universal .
rights do not depend on membership of a particular community or citizenship in a certain state . they do not derive from a social contract .
rather , because rights are universal , they are attributes of all human beings .
indeed , they are part of what makes us human .
each of us may enjoy rights .
those who exercise power may do so only in limited ways .
the limits are set by rights .
it is , of course , possible to trace the concept of universal rights at least as far back as seventeenth-century English thinking about natural law .
the concept was partially embraced in the French Declaration of Rights of 1789 and , to a greater extent , in Thomas Jefferson ’ s language in the same era about “ inalienable rights . ” It also shaped the thinking of those in England who led the anti-slavery struggle of the second half of the eighteenth century , the first human rights movement .
yet the Universal Declaration marked a giant step forward , as the world ’ s governments – with abstentions from the Soviet bloc states , Saudi Arabia , and apartheid South Africa , but with no votes in opposition – agreed that rights should take precedence over state power .
one way to think about the six decades that have elapsed since the adoption of the Universal Declaration is as a struggle to implement its promises .
for a long time , it was a losing struggle , marked especially by the spread of both communist and anti-communist tyrannies .
things began to change in the 1980 ’ s with the fall of military dictatorships in Latin America and in such East Asian countries as the Philippines and South Korea , and with the growing number of people engaged in the struggle for human rights in the Soviet empire .
by the end of the decade , many Soviet bloc regimes had collapsed .
a factor that contributed to their demise was a shift in thinking that transformed the conflict between East and West away from one that emphasized economic systems . instead , it was the contrast between totalitarianism and respect for rights that completely discredited the oppressive regimes linked to Moscow and helped to bring them down .
South Africa ’ s largely peaceful transition to a multi-racial democracy in the early 1990 ’ s was a further advance for rights .
but the last decade of the twentieth century was also indelibly stained by ethnic cleansing in ex-Yugoslavia and genocide in Rwanda , and during the current decade the tide has seemed to turn against the rights cause .
powerful states such as China and Russia are not limiting themselves to authoritarian rule at home , but are also supporting those in other countries engaged in similar practices .
the same is true of lesser powers such as Iran and Venezuela .
Moreover , the United States has been squandering much of its capacity to promote human rights internationally . in responding to the terrorist attacks on its own soil on September 11 , 2001 , the US has resorted to such measures as prolonged indefinite detention without charges , trials before military commissions lacking due process safeguards , and cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment of detainees , including torture .
other governments and intergovernmental bodies have not filled the gap left by the US .
the new UN Human Rights Council has so far disappointed those who hoped that it would be a more principled and effective body than its discredited predecessor , the UN Human Rights Commission .
the European Union has been a positive force in promoting rights in those countries aspiring to membership , but it has not demonstrated a capacity to exercise influence worldwide .
today , the most effective force promoting human rights is global public opinion , informed and mobilized by the large and growing nongovernmental human rights movement , which , as in the recent war between Georgia and Russia , has focused international attention on violations of the laws of armed conflict that protect noncombatants .
it has also led the way in creating international criminal tribunals that prosecute and punish those who commit war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide .
these achievements are not stopping war , but they are reducing the number of terrible human rights violations that accompany armed conflict .
it is , of course , dismaying that 60 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , so many governments disregard the principles that they endorsed so long ago .
yet without the legitimacy derived from the Universal Declaration and its role in promoting compliance , the nongovernmental human rights movement could not have developed into a global force .
the fact that the movement continues to secure advances even in difficult times is an indication of the enduring significance of what was achieved in 1948 when the world ’ s governments declared that rights are universal .
in recent years , many experts and commentators have said that the Atlantic Alliance would crumble or become irrelevant .
as a former ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , I can say from experience that such dire predictions are nothing new .
as America ’ s current Secretary of Defense , it is clear to me that the transatlantic partnership is as relevant and essential as ever .
consider the historic events that have taken place in the past year and the role played by the United States and Europe .
NATO added seven new members – nations eager to contribute to the Alliance in powerful ways .
in Afghanistan , eight million voters , 40 % of them women , chose their first democratically elected President in 5,000 years .
in the Palestinian Authority , a democratically elected president offers the hope of a new chance for peace .
in Ukraine , ordinary citizens demonstrated the depth of their commitment to free and fair elections .
in Iraq , Saddam Hussein ’ s former subjects braved threats and voted for the first time with ballots that offered a choice of 70 political parties , rather than only one .
across the country , voters arrived on crutches and in donkey carts , passing by posters that threatened : “ You vote , you die . ” What a damaging blow to the extremists , whose ideology the voters so clearly rejected .
while there have been differences over Iraq , such issues among longtime friends are not new .
consider just a few of the divisions that have come up among NATO allies over the past decades .
in the 1960 ’ s , France decided to pull out of the NATO integrated command and asked NATO forces to leave its territory .
in the 1980 ’ s there was profound disagreement and controversy over President Ronald Reagan ’ s decision to deploy medium-range missiles in Europe .
in fact , as NATO Ambassador in the 1970 ’ s , I had to fly back to testify against legislation in the US Congress to withdraw America ’ s forces from Europe in the middle of the Cold War .
our Atlantic Alliance has navigated through some choppy seas over the years , but we have always been able to resolve the toughest issues .
that is because there is so much that unites us : common values , shared histories , and an abiding faith in democracy .
today , we also share a common enemy .
extremists have targeted all civilized societies across the globe : in New York and Washington ; Istanbul ; Madrid ; Beslan ; Bali ; and more .
they do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
they would like nothing better than for America and Europe to be at odds , rather than working together .
the arrests of numerous terrorist suspects last month by French and German authorities made clear that no one nation can do the critical work necessary to win the struggle against extremists .
often quietly , America and European nations are sharing intelligence , capturing terrorists , and disrupting their finances .
as a result , some three-quarters of known al-Qaeda leaders have been killed or captured , and others are on the run .
nor can any one nation stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .
this is why some 60 nations have joined the Proliferation Security Initiative in an effort to keep deadly weapons from dangerous regimes .
in 2003 , German , Italian , British , and American authorities confiscated nuclear equipment bound for Tripoli , leading to Libya ’ s decision to open its weapons inventories to inspectors .
every NATO nation has personnel serving in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan , which just changed command from a French to a Turkish general .
one of NATO ’ s newest members , Lithuania , is taking leadership of a Provincial Reconstruction Team – joining other European nations in contributing to Afghanistan ’ s stability and progress .
indeed , more than half of all NATO nations have had forces in both Afghanistan and Iraq .
as the Iraqi people take more steps along the challenging road to democracy , more NATO countries have agreed to help train Iraqi security personnel by providing funds or equipment and by establishing a war college and military academies .
members of NATO share much more than an alliance ; we are united by ties of blood and purpose , a heritage of liberty , and a calling to confront extremists ’ violence – and defeat it .
in the 60 years since World War II came to an end , we have counted on each other in times of peril and challenge .
I am old enough to remember both the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall , and the ascent and collapse of Nazism , of Fascism , and of Soviet Communism .
together the members of NATO have helped to protect Kosovo and recently brought aid to the victims of a devastating tsunami .
great achievements are possible when the Atlantic community is united .
that unity need not mean a uniformity of tactics or views , but rather a union of purpose .
those who cherish free political systems and free economic systems share similar hopes .
working together , those hopes can become realities for many more people .
Islamabad &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; As Pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on February 18 , many observers hope that the vote will usher in a period of stability and calm by lending popular legitimacy to the government .
but sometimes democracy is best served by refusing to participate .
the upcoming election , to be held under the illegal Provisional Constitutional Order ( PCO ) implemented following President Pervez Musharraf ’ s state of emergency on November 3 , is such a case , which is why my party and its coalition partners are boycotting the vote .
to be sure , contesting the election would provide my party with a great opportunity to take issues to the people .
in fact , my party ’ s support has been growing , with opinion polls now indicating that it is the second most popular in the frontier province – and gaining ground in every other province .
but elections by themselves don ’ t bring democracy .
Zimbabwe ’ s president , Robert Mugabe , loves elections .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been holding elections for 27 years .
Uzbekistan ’ s Islam Karimov has been in power for 30 years , and has just been “ elected ” to a fresh seven-year presidential term .
elections are meaningful only if they are perceived to be free and fair , which requires independent referees .
when my party started eleven years ago , we called ourselves the Movement For Justice .
we demanded an independent judiciary , because we believed that democracy and prosperity are impossible without the rule of law , and that the rule of law requires a judiciary that can act as a constraint on the government .
having gone to university in western countries , we were inspired by the American system of check and balances .
so it is a shock to us that the US State Department keeps talking about free and fair elections and abolishing the state of emergency , but without mentioning the reinstatement of the judges – including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court – that Musharraf illegally dismissed .
if the judges are not reinstated , how can there be free and fair elections ?
who decides what is free and fair ?
Musharraf ?
this is where the battle lines are now drawn , and where the future of the country will be decided .
if the Chief Justice and the judges are reinstated , we can move toward a genuine democratic system .
but if Musharraf manages to get his own PCO judges established in the country , then we will head toward a period of turmoil .
after all , how can the party of a man who has less than 5 % support win the election now without rigging it ?
unfortunately , most of the political parties have failed to stand up for the democratic process .
major parties like the Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) have decided to participate , following the lead of the late Benazir Bhutto ’ s People ’ s Party .
and , of all the major parties that are contesting the election , only the PMLN is demanding the reinstatement of the judges .
Fortunately , the people of Pakistan – students , opinion makers , and , above all , lawyers – are standing up for the judges , doing the work that should have been done by political parties .
we see lawyers marching , getting beaten up , filling the jails , and yet remaining resolute .
they are suffering huge financial losses by boycotting the courts , and yet they are determined that the Chief Justice must be reinstated .
so the dividing line in Pakistan is not between liberals and extremists , but between those who support the status quo and those who oppose it .
parties that call themselves democratic are not only going along with Musharraf in this fraudulent election , but are also helping to restore the status quo .
the solution to dysfunctional democracy is not military dictatorship , but more democracy .
Pakistanis understand democracy , because we have a democratic culture .
our founder was a great constitutionalist , and Pakistan came into being through the vote .
the problem has been that because we have lacked an independent judiciary , we have not had an independent election commission .
so all our elections , except for one in 1970 , have been rigged .
India , with which Pakistan shares a similar background , went through 40 years of dysfunctional democracy with a one-party system .
but in the last 16 years it has begun to reap the fruits of genuine democratic competition , because an independent judiciary and electoral commission gives people confidence that their vote can make a difference .
until we have the same in Pakistan , no election can be free and fair .
for two and a half years , I supported Musharraf and believed his promises to bring genuine democracy to Pakistan .
I ’ ve learned my lesson about Musharraf .
but , more importantly , no military dictator can succeed where Musharraf has so clearly failed .
Winston Churchill once said , “ War is too serious a business for generals . ” The same is true of democracy .
federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has allowed global stock markets to railroad him into a whopping 75-basis-point cut in interest rates just one week before the regularly scheduled meeting of the Fed ’ s decision-making Open Market Committee .
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet would never allow this to happen to the ECB – he manipulates markets ; markets don ’ t manipulate him .
indeed , with America ’ s economy in apparent freefall , Trichet is threatening euro-zone trade unions with pre-emptive interest-rate hikes unless they behave as he sees fit .
these threats may be proving counter-productive to the achievement of price stability in the euro-zone economy , the central bank ’ s primary objective .
for example , to make his threats of an interest-rate hike in the midst of a global slowdown credible , the ECB president is using his press conferences to tell the world how strong European growth is .
besides being at odds with reality , the claim of strong growth actually encourages the trade unions to ask for even higher wages .
and why shouldn ’ t they if things are as good as Trichet claims ?
Trichet also makes his job more difficult for himself by talking up Europe ’ s inflationary threat .
his colleague on the ECB Governing Council , Bundesbank president Axel Weber , seems to have gotten the message that the more ECB officials talk up inflationary fears , the more the trade unions will ask .
so he recently toned down his rhetoric by warning that euro-zone inflationary pressures should not be “ over-dramatized . ”
how true !
the essential economic reality confronting the ECB today is that the American economy is falling headlong into a serious slump – Bernanke ’ s surprise cut speaks volumes to this .
it defies economic logic to think that the global economy – including Europe – will escape its consequences .
as European growth slows , so will inflationary pressures .
so Trichet should relax , stop threatening others , and let the economic slowdown do the work for him .
even with sticky wages and prices in Europe , the global slowdown will reduce energy , commodity , and food prices on world markets , all of which are important factors behind currently elevated European inflation levels .
the crude oil price already has dropped substantially from its highs at the beginning of the year .
but the evolving slowdown is not the only reason the threat of a wage-price spiral in Europe is overblown .
Germany is facing a key wage negotiation with public-sector unions .
even if the unions win large wage increases – which is very likely and entirely justifiable given their past restraint – this will have only a negligible effect on Europe ’ s price stability .
increased public-sector wage costs mean increased government spending on wages .
if this is financed by cutbacks elsewhere in the budget , the main consequence will be only a re-distribution of government spending , which is not necessarily inflationary .
nor is it inflationary if the wage increases are financed by higher taxes .
only if the budget surplus diminishes would there be an inflationary impact , and that would not be due to a wage-price spiral , but to an increase in net government demand , which actually might not be a bad thing for an economy facing a potentially severe economic slowdown .
in the United States , it should be remembered , the need for a fiscal stimulus developed , so it seems , out of the blue .
the same may happen in Europe , especially given the ECB ’ s refusal to cut interest rates .
a decent settlement with public-sector workers could give Germany a “ backdoor ” fiscal stimulus just at the right moment – when aggregate demand is flagging .
the real problem with a generous wage settlement with public-sector unions is that private-sector unions could use it to get more than their productivity gains warrant .
contracts with the metal and chemical workers also are coming up for negotiation this year in Germany , and union leaders are talking tough .
Berthold Huber , the head of Germany ’ s huge IG Metall engineering union , recently promised his rank and file “ a mega year ” for pay increases .
but the global slowdown , which takes the fangs out of the strike threat , will keep private-sector workers in line no matter how much their leaders may rant and rave .
everyone , including bellicose trade unionists , tends to become more reasonable when the economy turns south .
rather than encourage the unions with exaggerated talk of strong European growth and inflationary excess – and disrespect them with threats and interventions – Trichet should speak softly and let nature take its course .
Amsterdam &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; When “ tolerance ” becomes a term of abuse in a place like the Netherlands , you know that something has gone seriously wrong .
the Dutch always took pride in being the most tolerant people on earth .
in less feverish times than these , no one could possibly have taken exception to Queen Beatrix ’ s speech last Christmas , when she pleaded for tolerance and “ respect for minorities . ”
but Geert Wilders , leader of the right-wing , anti-Muslim Freedom Party , was so disgusted by the Dutch queen ’ s “ multi-cultural rubbish ” that he wanted her to be stripped of her constitutional role in the government .
Wilders , a popular rabble-rouser whose party occupies nine seats in the Dutch parliament , compares the Koran to Hitler ’ s Mein Kampf , wants to stop Muslims from moving to the Netherlands , and thunders that those who are already in the country should tear up half the Koran if they wish to stay .
tolerance towards Islam is cowardly appeasement in his eyes .
he thinks that Europe is in peril of being “ Islamized . ” “ There will soon be more mosques than churches , ” he says , if true Europeans don ’ t have the guts to stand up and save Western civilization .
notwithstanding his call to ban the Koran , Wilders and his admirers claim to believe in unfettered free speech as a Western birthright .
Beatrix stated that the right to free speech does not automatically mean the right to offend .
Wilders disagrees .
no criticism of Islam , however offensive , should ever be hampered by political correctness .
Wilders uses every opportunity to test Muslims ’ ( often very limited ) tolerance .
his latest provocation is a short film denouncing Islam , which is yet to be shown , but has already caused panic all around .
remarkably for a Dutch politician – and a minor one , at that – news of Wilders ’ s antics has reached the world press .
so Dutch embassies are bracing themselves for violent demonstrations , and the government is considering special security measures .
some commentators suggest that Wilders , born and raised as a Catholic in a provincial Dutch town , is , like his Muslim enemies , a true believer , driven by the goal of keeping Europe “ Judeo-Christian . ”
perhaps , but this is probably a red herring .
his war on Islam is also , and perhaps even mainly , a war on the cultural and political elites , the Dutch intellectual establishment , the Eurocrats of Brussels , and the liberal-minded queen .
indeed , his speeches are studded with references to arrogant elites who are out of touch with the feelings of the common man . “ Tolerance ” is seen as weak and elitist , typical of people who live far removed from the harsh realities of the street , where violent and unruly foreigners menace upstanding Dutch folks .
this notion of the elitist appeaser is not confined to the Netherlands .
in Israel , the educated Jewish activists who criticize Israeli abuses against Palestinians , the peaceniks who believe that negotiation is better than violence and that even Arabs have rights , are called , with a knowing sneer , “ beautiful souls . ”
the common man , rooted in the real world , supposedly knows better : uncompromising toughness , the hard line , is the only way to get results .
in the United States , the word “ liberal , ” in the mouths of populist radio hosts and right-wing politicians , has become almost synonymous with “ effete East Coast snob ” or , worse , “ New York intellectual . ”
liberals , in this view , are not only soft , but are somehow distinctly un-American .
the association of elites with foreignness , tolerance , and metropolitan cities is nothing new .
elites often can speak foreign languages , and big cities are traditionally more tolerant and open to mixed populations .
modern populism – American politicians running , or pretending to run , “ against Washington , ” or French populists speaking for “ deep France ” – is invariably hostile to capital cities .
Brussels , the capital of the European Union , stands for everything populists , whether left or right , hate .
and Muslim immigrants live in Amsterdam , London , or Marseilles , not in the kind of small towns where right-wing populists find most of their support .
still , the politics of resentment works best when it can tap into real fears .
there are reasons for people to feel anxious about economic globalization , pan-European bureaucracy , the huge and not always effectively controlled influx of immigrants , and the aggression of radical political Islam .
these anxieties have too often been ignored .
there is a sense among many Europeans , not just in the Netherlands , that they have been abandoned in a fast-changing world , that multi-national corporations are more powerful than nation-states , that the urban rich and highly educated do fine and ordinary folks in the provinces languish , while democratically elected politicians are not only powerless , but have abjectly surrendered to these larger forces that threaten the common man .
tolerance is seen as not just weak , but as a betrayal .
the Muslim threat is , of course , not a fantasy .
a small number of ideological extremists has inflicted real violence in the name of Islam , and will continue to do so .
but the popular resentment of Islam goes deeper and wider .
Wilders , and others like him , are not just attacking Islamic extremists .
his success is based on that sense of tolerance as betrayal .
and , as so often happens , the loathing of elites has found an outlet in the loathing of outsiders , who look different and whose ways are strange .
we must fight Islamic extremism , but not by tapping into the darkest gut feelings of the unthinking mob .
nothing good ever came from that .
London – Earlier this month , the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) upheld the request of the court ’ s chief prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for Omar el-Bashir , the President of Sudan , charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Bashir responded by expelling foreign aid agencies looking after the refugee camps in Darfur .
this is the first time that a sitting head of state has been indicted for war crimes , with reaction around the world mainly divided between those who hailed the move as a great step for international justice and those who condemned it as colonialism .
both positions are hopelessly buried in intellectual and moral fog .
the warrant was no leap forward .
from the legal point of view , it makes no difference whether the accused is a sitting or former head of state .
but it makes an enormous practical difference that an incumbent ruler can do a lot more future damage to his people than an ex-ruler , and therefore should be given no incentive to retaliate .
as a result of Bashir ’ s policies , 300,000 people are estimated to have died and 2.7 million displaced in Darfur .
the expulsion of the aid agencies has put over a million Darfuris at risk of epidemics and starvation .
according to the statute that established the ICC , the prosecutor is required to ensure that any prosecution is in the interests of the victims as well as of justice .
but , to lawyers like the ICC prosecutor , the abstract claims of justice are more vivid than any concrete duty of protection .
in this case , justice comes with poisoned arrows .
emboldened by the warrant and its elusive suggestion of international support , the Darfuri rebels , the Justice and Equality Movement , have walked out of peace talks with Sudan ’ s government .
meanwhile , Bashir , with little to lose , will no doubt take the opportunity to attack his enemies .
the counter-argument is that the threat of indictment will deter rulers from wicked behavior .
but the law will deter only if its sanctions are credible .
a law that cannot be enforced deters no one .
in fact , it weakens respect for law .
Moreover , while the fear of being hauled off to The Hague may havesome effect in deterring rulers from committing crimes against humanity , the claim that the Bashir warrant will deter the current crop of human rights ’ violators is derisory .
indeed , it is likely to prolong wicked regimes .
Robert Mugabe , for example , refuses to leave office – at great cost to Zimbabwe ’ s people – for fear of being put on trial .
whatever the attractions of giving criminals “ nowhere to hide , whatever the consequences , ” the consequences cannot be ignored when the criminals are heads of state .
the policy of never negotiating with terrorists cannot be scaled up to state level when hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake .
the charge of colonialism , meanwhile , is simply reflex : colonialism no longer exists .
the charge that international law isjust “ western law ” is also rubbish .
international law is the conscience of mankind .
but the perception that the law is selectively applied happens to be true .
in the Nuremberg trial of 1946 , which laid the basis of current international law , the main charge against the Nazi leaders was that of “ planning and waging aggressive war . ”
Prohibition of war except for self-defense is embedded in the United Nations Charter .
but the ICC ’ s creators deemed the waging of aggressive war – which the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg called “ the supreme international crime ” – to be outside the court ’ s jurisdiction .
this guaranteed legal immunity for the leaders who carried out the invasion of Iraq .
the charge of selective application also applies to the Bashir warrant .
Bashir stands accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the latter were first defined in the Nuremberg principles of 1950 to include murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation and “ other inhumane acts . ”
in 1998 , these other acts were clarified to mean false imprisonment , torture , rape , persecution of a group , enforced disappearance of persons , and apartheid .
it comes as no surprise , then , to read in theArab News that Bashir ’ s warrant “ reeks of hypocrisy . ”
where , indeed , are the arrest warrants for Bush and Cheney ?
does extraordinary rendition not count as “ enforced disappearance of persons ” ?
does the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not count as torture ?
why is Vladimir Putin not standing trial for war crimes in Chechnya ?
the answer is simple : where the interests of a UN Security Council member or one of their clients are at stake , the court ’ s jurisdiction ends .
the ICC is like a cobweb : small flies get stuck , but wasps and hornets get through .
until the United States ratifies the ICC treaty , the Court is bound to seem to many to be little more than a politicized kangaroo court .
without American support , it has little hope of earning legitimacy , let alone doing its job effectively .
the Security Council has the power to defer the warrant for Bashir ’ s arrest for renewable periods of one year .
it can do this indefinitely , and it seems likely that it will .
the idea is that deferring the warrant will give the Security Council leverage over Sudan .
Gareth Evans , a former Australian Foreign Minister , has called it “ a powerful diplomatic tool , ” while theWashington Post has called for the warrant to be used “ as a bargaining chip with Mr. Bashir and his Chinese and Arab allies . ”
they believe that the threat of arrest can be used to force Bashir to mend his ways .
if this proves true , the ICC and its sponsors have muddled justice with diplomacy .
if the world can dispense justice only at the expense of the weak and to the advantage of the strong , it should stick to the older tools of crime prevention : force and negotiation , and leave justice out of it .
LOS ANGELES – As the United States stumbles through its economic challenges at home , the pressure of world events will not subside .
but America ’ s ability to address them has changed .
its fiscal weakness limits its ability to act as global policeman .
despite the relatively costless overthrow of the Qaddafi regime , America ’ s prolonged interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq have severely strained the public ’ s tolerance for an active foreign policy .
nonetheless , the US seems destined to remain the world ’ s most important actor for the foreseeable future .
but today it is an actor without a script – it lacks a strategic guide comparable to the Cold War ’ s containment doctrine to prioritize policy .
quite simply , the ad hoc policymaking that directed interventions in the Balkans , Somalia , southwest Asia , and the Middle East in the past two decades will not suffice in this new era of limitations .
this suggests that the US should seek out an overarching strategy to discipline its impulses to fight wars of choice or engage in nation-building efforts .
President Barack Obama ’ s 2010 National Security Strategy nurtures broad policy aspirations – “ &#91; n &#93; ow we must position the United States to champion mutual interests among nations and peoples ” – but falls short as a practical guide .
I suggest an alternative strategy , one already embedded in America history , though largely unrecognized .
but making explicit what lies implicit can sharpen US decision-making .
I call this strategy the “ Watershed Doctrine . ”
a watershed is a tipping point , a turning point , a game changer .
when the US has confronted a “ negative watershed ” – a lethal threat to the country – it committed meaningful financial and human resources in order to address the risks .
positive watersheds – opportunities to engineer seismic shifts in international or regional political affairs through nation-building , or to use economic and military assistance to prevent plausible negative watersheds – demand an equal level of commitment .
the Watershed concept provides policymakers with a standard to use – or at the very least to debate .
it is an organizing tool for policymaking : is an international challenge a watershed or not ?
if so , get involved .
if not , stay out .
we find watersheds throughout American history .
the War of 1812 and the Civil War are clear examples .
had American forces not expelled the British from US territory in the first , and had Abraham Lincoln and the Union not prevailed in the second , the country would have been balkanized and unable to become the dominant power of the twentieth century .
by contrast , America ’ s flirtation with colonialism in the Spanish American War , its involvement in Mexico , Central America , and the Caribbean throughout the twentieth century , and , arguably , World War I , were not watersheds for the US .
but America ’ s inability after the Great War to overcome Old World politics at Versailles and isolationism at home marked a failed opportunity to promote a positive watershed .
that failure placed the world on the path to the negative watershed posed by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan .
nothing foreordained that the US and its allies would prevail .
had the Axis ’ s negative watershed succeeded , the US would have become a far different country .
a positive watershed , under-appreciated today , developed in the years immediately after World War II with the political transformation of Germany and Japan .
America ’ s remarkable investment of resources in this outcome made both countries stable , peaceful democracies , thereby eliminating them as adversaries and turning them into vital bulwarks against the next harbinger of a negative watershed , the Soviet Union .
unlike the battle against the Axis , the US fought the Cold War in many ways , on many fronts , and over many decades – using politics , economics , and nuclear deterrence , as well as limited armed action , to ensure the USSR ’ s containment .
in time , the US had to accept that each political contest or military battle lost was not a watershed as long as its core interests in Europe , the Far East , and Latin America were not threatened .
through trial and error – backed by a durable political and economic system – the US prevailed and the Soviet Union disintegrated .
the rise of Islamic fundamentalism poses another historic challenge , though one that is far more inchoate than any that the US has faced before .
in other times , the challenge would not even be called a watershed .
but the risk that weapons of mass destruction could be turned against the US makes it so .
then there is the “ Arab Spring , ” a potential positive watershed that calls upon the US to decide how deep a political , economic , and military commitment it ought to make to nurture positive results .
today , the US is a more sober and realistic country than it was in the heyday of the early post-Cold War period .
but , in the aftermath of setbacks in regions where it intervened , and with heightened economic distress at home , the US finds itself uncertain about how to respond to changing global events .
pursuing a “ Watershed Doctrine ” might provide the right answer .
LOS ANGELES – A strange sense of déjà vu is gripping Washington these days , as the debate over ratification by the United States Senate of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( New START ) with Russia heats up .
Spats have broken out between the Obama administration , future presidential contenders , senators , and arms control and defense experts .
there may not be nostalgia for the Cold War in any of this , but much of that era ’ s mindset can be perceived again in the arguments being knocked about .
the Senate must decide whether New START enhances American security .
unfortunately , whatever the decision -- which has been delayed perhaps until late Fall to allow Obama ’ s administration more time to muster support for the treaty -- the US and Russian governments will continue to place each other in the nuclear crosshairs for the foreseeable future .
new START builds on a legacy of strategic nuclear arms limitation that goes back to the 1970 ’ s .
former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger captured the allure in recent testimony : “ The subject of nuclear arms control grew out of the seemingly paradoxical effort of those who had created the largest and most destructive arsenals to avoid by negotiation the ultimate consequences of their own decisions . ”
over the years “ avoiding … the ultimate consequences ” through limitations butted against the bitter legacy of the surprise attacks suffered by both the US and Russia in World War II .
after the war , each adopted a “ never be surprised again ” policy , and so went on to invest trillions of dollars in a multitude of hardened , mobile , and concealed nuclear weapons to deter the other .
the result produced tens of thousands of nuclear warheads .
in time , strategic arms control treaties became the measure of the political relationship .
with the Soviet Union ’ s collapse , a unique opportunity to end the nuclear competition emerged .
while elimination did take place in the former Soviet Republics , the Kremlin hung on to its nuclear arsenal – the last vestige of Russia ’ s former superpower status .
likewise , US administrations have remained wedded to the Bomb .
as a result , the “ nuclear hostage ” relationship of the Cold War continued , capped in 2002 by the Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty , which set the upper limit on warheads at 2,200 by 2012 .
in the spring of 2009 , speaking in Prague , Obama advanced a bold ambition : a world without nuclear weapons .
but his audacity confronted a world in which the Bomb remained at the heart of many countries ’ deterrence strategies .
Obama muddled his message further by admitting that he did not expect to see abolition in his lifetime .
nonetheless , New START marks a step in the direction of disarmament .
it would limit each country to 1,550 strategic warheads on 700 deployed delivery vehicles .
verification relies on 18 on-site inspections , notification of forces in and out of service , missile-test flight information and other data exchanges , plus a consultative commission to iron out compliance .
were the US Senate to fail to ratify New START , the treaty ’ s proponents argue that the US would lose predictability about Russia ’ s nuclear activities , resulting in greater distrust and risk of miscalculation , making both sides less secure .
but arms-control skeptics take issue with this .
throughout the Cold War , they viewed restraints on America ’ s development and fielding of nuclear weapons as compromising national security .
fears that the Soviet Union would cheat reinforced their position .
and cheating did indeed upset the broader superpower relationship .
today , similar apprehensions stoke opposition to New START .
to allay such concerns , the Obama administration committed to a multi-year increase in the budgets of the US military ’ s nuclear-weapons laboratories .
and in the April 10 release of the Nuclear Posture Review , Obama ’ s administration warned nuclear-armed states and others tempted to violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that they would remain nuclear targets .
missile defense has become another bone of contention .
the language in the preamble to New START states that the agreement will not “ undermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties . ”
critics contend that the clause , along with the Kremlin ’ s implied warning that it could withdraw from the treaty unilaterally were America ’ s defenses to become too robust , provides the Kremlin with leverage to impede deployment of any strategic missile-defense system .
the Obama administration repeatedly denies such claims , along with others that the treaty ’ s verification provisions remain insufficient .
it scoffs at assertions that Russia would cheat by multiplying warheads on bombers or new rail-based missile carriers , arguing that the Kremlin would want to avoid America ’ s compensatory response .
but Obama ’ s team does concede one point : new START fails to curtail Russia ’ s large numerical advantage in tactical nuclear weapons .
arguing that short-range devices pose no risk to the American homeland , US negotiators plan to press for reductions in follow-on talks .
despite the claims by both the Bush and Obama administrations that Russia and the US are no longer adversaries , it seems that the rapprochement has not translated into elimination of mutual nuclear targeting .
the result , even if new START is ratified , should satisfy no one .
new YORK – The world is at a crossroads .
either the global community will join together to fight poverty , resource depletion , and climate change , or it will face a generation of resource wars , political instability , and environmental ruin .
the World Bank , if properly led , can play a key role in averting these threats and the risks that they imply .
the global stakes are thus very high this spring as the Bank ’ s 187 member countries choose a new president to succeed Robert Zoellick , whose term ends in July .
the World Bank was established in 1944 to promote economic development , and virtually every country is now a member .
its central mission is to reduce global poverty and ensure that global development is environmentally sound and socially inclusive .
achieving these goals would not only improve the lives of billions of people , but would also forestall violent conflicts that are stoked by poverty , famine , and struggles over scarce resources .
American officials have traditionally viewed the World Bank as an extension of United States foreign policy and commercial interests .
with the Bank just two blocks away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue , it has been all too easy for the US to dominate the institution .
now many members , including Brazil , China , India , and several African countries , are raising their voices in support of more collegial leadership and an improved strategy that works for all .
from the Bank ’ s establishment until today , the unwritten rule has been that the US government simply designates each new president : all 11 have been Americans , and not a single one has been an expert in economic development , the Bank ’ s core responsibility , or had a career in fighting poverty or promoting environmental sustainability .
instead , the US has selected Wall Street bankers and politicians , presumably to ensure that the Bank ’ s policies are suitably friendly to US commercial and political interests .
yet the policy is backfiring on the US and badly hurting the world .
because of a long-standing lack of strategic expertise at the top , the Bank has lacked a clear direction .
many projects have catered to US corporate interests rather than to sustainable development .
the Bank has cut a lot of ribbons on development projects , but has solved far too few global problems .
for too long , the Bank ’ s leadership has imposed US concepts that are often utterly inappropriate for the poorest countries and their poorest people .
for example , the Bank completely fumbled the exploding pandemics of AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria during the 1990 ’ s , failing to get help to where it was needed to curb these outbreaks and save millions of lives .
even worse , the Bank advocated user fees and “ cost recovery ” for health services , thereby putting life-saving health care beyond the reach of the poorest of the poor – precisely those most in need of it .
in 2000 , at the Durban AIDS Summit , I recommended a new “ Global Fund ” to fight these diseases , precisely on the grounds that the World Bank was not doing its job .
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria emerged , and has since saved millions of lives , with malaria deaths in Africa alone falling by at least 30 % .
the Bank similarly missed crucial opportunities to support smallholder subsistence farmers and to promote integrated rural development more generally in impoverished rural communities in Africa , Asia , and Latin America .
for around 20 years , roughly from 1985 to 2005 , the Bank resisted the well-proven use of targeted support for small landholders to enable impoverished subsistence farmers to improve yields and break out of poverty .
more recently , the Bank has increased its support for smallholders , but there is still far more that it can and should do .
the Bank ’ s staff is highly professional , and would accomplish much more if freed from the dominance of narrow US interests and viewpoints .
the Bank has the potential to be a catalyst of progress in key areas that will shape the world ’ s future .
its priorities should include agricultural productivity ; mobilization of information technologies for sustainable development ; deployment of low-carbon energy systems ; and quality education for all , with greater reliance on new forms of communication to reach hundreds of millions of under-served students .
the Bank ’ s activities currently touch on all of these areas , but it fails to lead effectively on any of them .
despite the excellence of its staff , the Bank has not been strategic or agile enough to be an effective agent of change .
getting the Bank ’ s role right will be hard work , requiring expertise at the top .
most importantly , the Bank ’ s new president should have first-hand professional experience regarding the range of pressing development challenges .
the world should not accept the status quo .
a World Bank leader who once again comes from Wall Street or from US politics would be a heavy blow for a planet in need of creative solutions to complex development challenges .
the Bank needs an accomplished professional who is ready to tackle the great challenges of sustainable development from day one . &amp; nbsp ;
new YORK – In almost every part of the world , long-festering problems can be solved through closer cooperation among neighboring countries .
the European Union provides the best model for how neighbors that have long fought each other can come together for mutual benefit .
ironically , today ’ s decline in American global power may lead to more effective regional cooperation .
this may seem an odd time to praise the EU , given the economic crises in Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Ireland .
Europe has not solved the problem of balancing the interests of strong economies in the North and those of weaker economies in the South .
still , the EU ’ s accomplishments vastly outweigh its current difficulties .
the EU has created a zone of peace where once there was relentless war .
it has provided the institutional framework for reuniting Western and Eastern Europe .
it has fostered regional-scale infrastructure .
the single market has been crucial to making Europe one of the most prosperous places on the planet .
and the EU has been a global leader on environmental sustainability .
for these reasons , the EU provides a unique model for other regions that remain stuck in a mire of conflict , poverty , lack of infrastructure , and environmental crisis .
new regional organizations , such as the African Union , look to the EU as a role model for regional problem-solving and integration .
yet , to this day , most regional groupings remain too weak to solve their members ’ pressing problems .
in most other regions , ongoing political divisions have their roots in the Cold War or the colonial era .
during the Cold War , neighbors often competed with each other by “ choosing sides ” – allying themselves with either the United States or the Soviet Union . Pakistan tilted towards the Americans ; India towards the Soviets .
countries had little incentive to make peace with their neighbors as long as they enjoyed the financial support of the US or the USSR .
on the contrary , continued conflict often led directly to more financial aid .
indeed , the US and Europe often acted to undermine regional integration , which they believed would limit their roles as power brokers .
thus , when Gamal Abdel Nasser launched a call for Arab unity in the 1950 ’ s , the US and Europe viewed him as a threat . the US undercut his call for strong Arab cooperation and nationalism , fearing a loss of American influence in the Middle East .
as a result , Nasser increasingly aligned Egypt with the Soviet Union , and ultimately failed in the quest to unite Arab interests .
today ’ s reality , however , is that great powers can no longer divide and conquer other regions , even if they try .
the age of colonialism is finished , and we are now moving beyond the age of US global dominance .
recent events in the Middle East and Central Asia , for example , clearly reflect the decline of US influence .
America ’ s failure to win any lasting geopolitical advantage through the use of military force in Iraq and Afghanistan underscore the limits of its power , while its budget crisis ensures that it will cut its military resources sooner rather than later .
similarly , the US played no role in the political revolutions underway in the Arab world , and still has not demonstrated any clear policy response to them .
President Barack Obama ’ s recent speech on the Middle East is a further display of America ’ s declining influence in the region .
the speech drew the most attention for calling on Israel to return to its 1967 borders , but the effect was undercut when Israel flatly rejected the US position .
the world could see that there would be little practical follow-up .
the rest of the speech was even more revealing , though it drew little public notice .
when Obama discussed the Arab political upheavals , he noted the importance of economic development .
yet when it came to US action , the most that the US could offer financially was slight debt relief for Egypt ( $ 1 billion ) , scant loan guarantees ( $ 1 billion ) , and some insurance coverage for private investments .
the real message was that the US government would contribute very little financially to the region ’ s economic recovery .
the days when a country could depend on large-scale American financing are over .
we are , in short , moving to a multi-polar world .
the Cold War ’ s end has not led to greater US dominance , but rather to the dissemination of global power to many regions . East Asia , South Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East have new geopolitical and economic influence .
each region , increasingly , must find its own path to economic development , energy and food security , and effective infrastructure , and must do so in a world threatened by climate change and resource scarcity .
each region , therefore , will have to secure its own future .
of course , this should occur in a context of cooperation across regions as well as within them .
the Middle East is in a strong position to help itself .
there is a high degree of economic complementarity between Egypt and the oil-rich Gulf States .
Egypt can supply technology , manpower , and considerable expertise for the Arab region , while the Gulf provides energy and finance , as well as some specialists .
the long-delayed vision of Arab economic unity should be returned to the table .
Israel , too , should recognize that its long-term security and prosperity will be enhanced as part of an economically stronger region .
for the sake of its own national interests , Israel must come to terms with its neighbors .
other regions also will find that the decline of US power increases the urgency of stronger cooperation between neighbors .
some of the greatest tensions in the world – say India and Pakistan , or North and South Korea – should be defused as part of region-wide strengthening .
as the EU shows , ancient enmities and battle lines can be turned into mutually beneficial cooperation if a region looks forward , to resolving its long-term needs , rather than backward , to its long-standing rivalries and conflicts .
Berlin : like old battle horses feeling young as the bugle sounds , Cold War strategists are feeling the adrenalin mount as missile defense becomes front page news .
true , the defense against missiles which Bill Clinton ( reluctantly ) and George W. Bush ( enthusiastically ) are proposing – with massive support from America ’ s Congress – is different from Ronald Reagan ’ s Star Wars dream of twenty years ago : NMD is supposed to catch only a modest number of warheads , not provide complete protection against enemy missiles .
nevertheless , the issue rekindles old debates over deterrence , mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control , and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers just when nuclear weapons had lost much of their relevance .
Amazingly , debate is heating up even though it is uncertain that NMD will work .
even if it does work , it will be ten to fifteen years , possibly longer , before NMD is operational .
so tempers are rising over something which , if and when it happens in the distant future , may or may not have much impact .
normally cautious governments are positioning themselves now as if the future were around the corner .
what explains this odd behavior ?
not blind faith in technology .
after all , the history of missile defense is a tale of technology constantly disappointing its advocates in and out of government .
no one in his right mind can assume that something never achieved before , namely destroying a small number of warheads in flight , will happen over night .
of the three tests so far conducted , one failed almost , two entirely , which is why President Clinton left the matter to his successor .
if President Bush , as he has hinted , now favors a different design , it will take even more time to develop the architecture and devise a test program .
nobody can be sure that it will work either .
governments are worried now , not because of capabilities , but because of America ’ s real or imagined intentions .
while Americans claim that NMD is not directed against anyone , that all the US wants is to protect its citizens against states like Iraq or North Korea , almost everyone else thinks differently : Russians fear that America wants to cement its military superiority ( and Russia &apos;s inferiority ) forever ; the Chinese are concerned that NMD signals American readiness to help Taiwan remain independent ; Europeans worry that America &apos;s plans invite tensions with Russia and may separate the US from Europe .
because political intentions , not technical capabilities matter , NMD creates problems now : it pushes Russia into confrontation , heightens Chinese nervousness , and underpins a European sense of estrangement from the US .
damage is done from the word go while the end of the road remains obscured .
inflating this political damage is the fact that , thirty years ago , the US and the then Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles .
normally , a US defense project in its infancy would not cause the excitement NMD generates .
but the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits , for the indefinite future , systems to protect either country against such nuclear attack .
as the US proceeds with NMD , it will either have to violate the Treaty or give six months notice to quit , something both signatories are entitled to do if they feel their vital security interests demand it .
in the eyes of many , that would amount to America opting out of the structure of nuclear arms control built in the latter part of the Cold War .
the Bush Administration argues that , because the Cold War is over , the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not mean a loss of nuclear stability .
but stability is as much a matter of political perceptions as of technical calculations .
by limiting strategic missile defense , the old treaty provides a certain predictability of deterrence for all nuclear weapon states .
its disappearance would affect all other arms control agreements .
Russia threatens to scrap all of them once the US leaves the ABM-Treaty .
while this threat lacks credibility ( it would harm Russian interests most ) it has a certain logic .
the main question NMD poses is not how to prepare for a future world of missile defense but how to dampen today ’ s political concerns .
such efforts are getting discretely underway .
legal experts in Washington suggest that modest preparations for building missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM-Treaty and so do not yet require a US notice to quit .
for now , the Bush Administration will await the outcome of tests before deciding .
both Moscow and Washington hint at possible deep cuts in their offensive nuclear arsenals .
skeptical European allies are being mollified by US assurances of close consultation .
the most important of confidence-building measures , a modification of the ABM-Treaty to allow for limited missile defense , is being explored .
Russia ’ s early &quot; nyet &quot; may not be the last word .
so political turmoil with Russia and Europe might be calmed .
but what about China ?
in contrast to Europe and Russia , China is not party to an alliance ( as is Europe ) or to a network of arms control treaties through which political solutions can evolve ( like Russia ) , factors that contribute to Asian instabilities and Chinese sensitivity .
here confidence can only be built through the approach taken by the US to China .
Regrettably , there are no indications yet that the problem is recognized in Washington as a serious one .
all this comes as a disappointment to old Cold War strategists .
while brushing up the vocabulary and abbreviations of the age of superpower deterrence , they discover that such a world has gone .
missile defense is not a threat to US-Russian strategic stability ; its mishandling is a threat to political predictability .
by announcing its determination to go ahead with a distant NMD , the US has created political turbulence which it must address now if major damage is to be avoided .
Yukos , once Russia ’ s leading oil company and a favorite of international investors , is in its death throes .
at what many perceived to be a rigged auction , the company ’ s best assets were sold off to a previously unknown bidder and are now back in the hands of the Russian state .
the shell of what remains continues to challenge the company ’ s fate , notably in a Houston , Texas courtroom .
but these spasms will not revive the corpse .
what matters now is whether Russia ’ s economy will share Yukos ’ s fate .
the damage to Russia ’ s economic growth prospects from the Yukos affair may yet prove temporary , barring a repeat performance with other companies .
but whether the Yukos affair proves to be an isolated case , as the Kremlin insists , depends on a reading of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’ s motives .
one possibility is that Putin is not sincere about his aim of doubling Russia ’ s GDP in a decade .
recent opinion polls suggest that this is the view of much of Russia ’ s cynical public .
on this view , the privatizations of the 1990 ’ s were a scam serving only the powers that be .
but any reversal of those privatizations – such as the effective expropriation of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his Menatep partners in Yukos – signifies not the dawn of social justice but rather a new group of bosses “ expropriating the expropriators , ” as Lenin used to say .
a less nihilistic view is that the Yukos affair suggests above all a series of improvisations by Putin rather than a coherent agenda .
this is somewhat reassuring .
much evidence points to the affair originating not in a systematic nationalization project , but rather in the Kremlin ’ s perception that Khodorkovsky aimed to use his wealth to privatize the Russian state itself .
such “ state capture ” occurred in Russia in the late 1990 ’ s and to an even greater extent under the Kuchma regime in neighboring Ukraine which , ironically , Putin tried to preserve .
neutralizing the perceived threat from Khodorkovsky meant depriving him of the means to achieve his ambitions by separating his Menatep Group from Yukos ’ s future cash flows .
the massive tax claims against Yukos used for this purpose were precisely that – the means rather than the end .
had the goal been mere recovery of tax arrears , there would have been no need to break up the company : Yukos could have settled even these colossal liabilities on a civilized installment schedule .
to be sure , expropriating Menatep made shares in Yukos – a company that by 2003 attracted more domestic and foreign savings than any other in Russia – virtually worthless .
but this seems like collateral damage from the pursuit of an overriding political objective .
much now depends on whether the same is true of the other major outcome , which is that Yukos ’ s principal asset – Yuganskneftegaz – is now in state hands , while its remaining units appear doomed to nationalization .
is this another incidental by-product of the campaign against Khodorkovsky , or is it part of the core Kremlin agenda ?
nationalization certainly seems to appeal to the powerful faction comprising Putin ’ s former KGB colleagues and associates from his native St. Petersburg , one of whom last year became the chairman of Rosneft , the wholly state-owned oil company which acquired Yuganskneftegaz .
but if the influence of these so-calledsiloviki was unbridled , similar attacks would have been launched against other major companies by now .
as it is , even Roman Abramovich ’ s Sibneft – potentially the most vulnerable company due to its oligarch ownership and its use of the same tax minimization schemes that were the undoing of Yukos – merely faces a preliminary claim for back taxes .
in contrast to Yukos , the claim does not exceed the company ’ s cash on hand and so poses no threat to its existence .
even the nationalization of Yukos ’ s assets may reflect little more than the absence of alternative buyers , given the obvious political obstacle passing those assets on to other domestic private-sector players ( i.e. , oligarchs ) , and the legal and reputational barriers to foreign investors .
so the interpretation that best fits the facts so far is that the political aim of separating Khodorkovsky and Menatep from Yukos led in practice to nationalization , but that this was not the underlying goal .
there is no green light for opportunistic predators in and around the Kremlin who now control Yuganskneftegaz to grab other companies ’ assets at will .
if so , the damage caused by the Yukos affair should be minimal .
yet , even on the assumption that Putin has no plans to nationalize key natural resource companies , he clearly desires strong state control over these “ commanding heights ” of the economy .
that in itself will result in overall GDP growth falling below potential , owing to the inferior productivity and greater corruption in the major companies that the state controls or heavily influences .
in a speech marking the state gas monopoly Gazprom ’ s tenth anniversary in 2003 , Putin stated his position explicitly , speaking of the company as one of the few strong geopolitical levers left to Russia after the Soviet collapse .
Putin ’ s geopolitical preoccupations could be accommodated by sensibly preserving state ownership of pipeline infrastructure in the hydrocarbons sector , while allowing private companies to extract , process , and sell Russia ’ s oil and gas .
instead , Putin has allowed Gazprom ’ s management to block proposals from his own government on the long overdue unbundling of the company .
Putin has sought an economic transformation of Russia similar in kind , if not in degree , to China ’ s boom .
the prize is higher living standards for Russia ’ s long-suffering people and a recovery in the country ’ s international standing .
despite uncertainty about Putin ’ s intentions , that prize is not out of reach .
indeed , at this point the only action more harmful than the Yukos affair would be another Yukos affair .
for almost two generations , Abba Eban was Israel &apos;s voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world .
since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940 &apos;s during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty , few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction .
with his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences , his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II .
as Ambassador to the United States and the UN , and later as Foreign Minister , he represented an Israel with which the world &apos;s liberal imagination could identify .
larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman , and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands .
his books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity .
his scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion .
rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature : only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him .
he was a true patriot , in the old-fashioned sense of the word : proud of his people , but never ethno-centric ; a man of the world , but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage ; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people , but never losing the universal horizon of mankind .
in short , he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word .
it was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages , all of them in Yiddish .
of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages , and all of them with an Oxford / Cambridge accent .
yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics .
perhaps Eban was too urbane , too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli &apos;s phrase - to the top of the greasy pole .
together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War .
he could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973 , yet it nonetheless brought him down as well .
he never found his way back , and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism , he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style .
in the international arena , Eban &apos;s pen was his sword , and the spoken word his lance .
he was less adept in political infighting in Israel .
he could be a fierce turf fighter , yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served .
it is far from clear if he would have prevailed , given his lack of an independent political base , but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet .
he never did .
Eban &apos;s silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health .
at a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists , the moral certitudes of Eban , for all their urbanity , may sound shallow .
but nation-building requires moral stamina , and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance .
without having spoken to Eban in the last few years , I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01 , and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding .
yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state .
as an Arabist by training , immersed in Arab and Muslim culture , he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated , that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism .
this was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab .
that this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban &apos;s greatest disappointment .
despite the high-born image Eban projected , he was an extremely vulnerable person : what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins .
while appearing to own the Queen &apos;s English , Eban was not to the manor born : he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry .
he was , in the true sense of the word , a self-made man , whose pluck , ambition , drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements .
his was the aristocracy of the spirit .
in this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented .
Crown Prince Abdullah ’ s peace proposal was born in Saudi Arabia but some allege that it was conceived in the US . revealed to a visiting American journalist during a private dinner with the Crown Prince , the plan centers on a “ full normalization ” of relations between Israel and all Arab countries , in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories it occupied in 1967 . the proposal may get a boost when Abdullah meet President Bush in Texas later this spring , but its early survival depends first on its reception at the upcoming Arab summit in Beirut .
the suspicions which surround Abdullah ’ s peace initiative , and which dismiss it as stillborn , are founded in the belief that it was conceived to appease Saudi Arabia ’ s American critics and to divert them from focussing on Saudi domestic tensions . since September 11th , Saudi Arabia has felt intense pressure to explain ( and explain away ) its links to Osama bin Laden ’ s al-Qaeda terrorist network because fifteen of the nineteen plane hijackers were Saudis ( indeed , the majority of prisoners held by the US at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are said to be Saudi citizens ) and Saudis are often viewed as a major source of al-Qaeda ’ s finances . Moreover , it is alleged that the Saudi government has become preoccupied with appeasing America , despite the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada , and Israel ’ s ongoing occupation of Palestine .
at the same time , Saudi public opinion has been inflamed , mostly because of their rulers ’ apparent apathy toward the plight of the Palestinian people , particularly when contrasted with Osama bin Laden ’ s lethal propaganda . since the terrorist attacks of September 11th , Saudi leaders have felt pressed to accommodate public revulsion about the mistreatment of the Palestinians , but worry that doing so may even further jeopardize their now brittle relations with America .
Crown Prince Abdullah ’ s initiative provoked widespread surprise , not because the idea is so startlingly new , but because of its source and timing . a proposal for “ full normalization ” with Israel coming from an Islamic regime that bases its legitimacy on the austere Islamic doctrines of the Wahhabi seems both peculiar and progressive . but Saudi Arabia ’ s long-cultivated image of stability , benevolence , and mystical communal harmony has given way under the endless glare of the American press . its educational system , too , is increasingly portrayed as a breeding ground for hatred of the West . something had to give .
America ’ s seemingly hostile attention gave rise to the speculation that Crown Prince Abdullah ’ s initiative really denotes a Saudi public relations counteroffensive , hatched in the Saudi embassy in Washington to cover over the rift with the US . indeed , the subsequent , deafening silence by other Saudi leaders to the proposal appears to confirm it as a public relations move for which they need not risk any of their own domestic political capital .
although Abdullah is usually referred to in the West as Saudi Arabia ’ s ruler , the debilitated King Fahd ’ s six full brothers are the ones who truly represent the real power in the Kingdom . almost nothing , neither in support nor in opposition , has been uttered by the King and these other brothers , collectively known as the “ Sudairis . ”
the Sudairis , it seems , have apparently left their half brother alone to twist in the wind . Abdullah ’ s proposal could weaken his position domestically , particularly in relation to the country ’ s powerful Islamists .
for although Crown Prince Abdullah has his own loyal entourage , including the National Guard , he confronts opposition from senior figures in the religious establishment .
the idea of normalizing relations with Israel has incited fierce hostility among some imams in the mosques as well as on the Internet .
as a result , Abdullah ’ s initial proposal has been diluted , so much so that , by the time of the Arab foreign ministers meeting held in Cairo on 8 March , the phrase “ full normalisation ” was watered down to the more amorphous phrase “ full peace , ” the meaning of which no one knows .
does it mean an Israeli Star of David flag flying in Riyadh , or that Abdullah will visit Jerusalem to be greeted with a kiss from Ariel Sharon ? no one knows , but the very fact that such questions are being raised in Saudi Arabia poses a serious risk to Abdullah .
objections are also voiced against the fact that the Crown Prince ’ s plan does not mention the right of exiled Palestinians to return to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza , as well as Israel proper , and that Arabs must tailor their diplomatic initiatives to the taste of the American media . to the average Saudi , the initiative appears as either a sell-out or the prelude to a fresh Arab humiliation . in either case , it is widely feared that either of these outcomes is intended simply to appease America .

reactions in the Middle East reflect longstanding rivalries for leadership , as well as fears about American and Israeli intentions . Egypt ’ s leaders deem the proposal a mere conversation , something not nearly as serious as a written diplomatic initiative . Libya offered its own supposedly more “ encompassing and comprehensive ” proposal .
Hizbollah ’ s leader Mohammed Fadlallah defined the initiative as one of Arab submission , while Syria demanded a guarantee of its interests in the Golan Heights .
Arab League officials approved the proposal .
Crown Prince Abdullah ’ s initiative is meant to be made official during a speech at the Arab League summit in Beirut of 27-28 March .
how it is received may not only determine the state of Israel-Palestine negotiations for a considerable time to come , but Saudi Arabia ’ s domestic peace as well .
as a species , human beings have a major self-control problem .
we humans are now so aggressively fishing , hunting , logging , and growing crops in all parts of the world that we are literally chasing other species off the planet .
our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life .
in 1992 , when the world ’ s governments first promised to address man-made global warming , they also vowed to head off the human-induced extinction of other species .
the Convention on Biological Diversity , agreed at the Rio Earth Summit , established that “ biological diversity is a common concern of humanity . ”
the signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity , by saving species and their habitats , and to use biological resources ( e.g. , forests ) in a sustainable manner .
in 2002 , the treaty ’ s signatories went further , committing to “ a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss ” by 2010 .
unfortunately , like so many other international agreements , the Convention on Biological Diversity remains essentially unknown , un-championed , and unfulfilled .
that neglect is a human tragedy .
for a very low cash outlay – and perhaps none at all on balance – we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods .
we kill other species not because we must , but because we are too negligent to do otherwise .
consider a couple of notorious examples .
some rich countries , such as Spain , Portugal , Australia , and New Zealand , have fishing fleets that engage in so-called “ bottom trawling . ”
bottom trawlers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom , destroying magnificent , unexplored , and endangered marine species in the process .
complex and unique ecologies , most notably underground volcanoes known as seamounts , are ripped to shreds , because bottom trawling is the “ low cost ” way to catch a few deep sea fish species .
one of these species , orange roughy , has been caught commercially for only around a quarter-century , but already is being fished to the point of collapse .
likewise , in many parts of the world , tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops .
the result is massive loss of habitat and destruction of species , yielding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost .
after cutting down a swath of rainforest , soils are often quickly leached of their nutrients so that they cannot sustain crops or nutritious grasses for livestock .
as a result , the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned , with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems .
because these activities ’ costs are so high and their benefits so low , stopping them would be easy .
bottom trawling should simply be outlawed ; it would be simple and inexpensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities .
forest clearing , on the other hand , is probably best stopped by economic incentives , perhaps combined with regulatory limits .
simply restricting the practice of land clearing probably would not work , since farm families and communities would face a strong temptation to evade legal limits .
on the other hand , financial incentives would probably succeed , because cutting down forest to create pastureland is not profitable enough to induce farmers to forego payments for protecting the land .
many rainforest countries have united in recent years to suggest the establishment of a rainforest conservation fund by the rich countries , to pay impoverished small farmers a small amount of money to preserve the forest .
a well-designed fund would slow or stop deforestation , preserve biodiversity , and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the burning of cleared forests .
at the same time , small farmers would receive a steady flow of income , which they could use for micro-investments to improve their household ’ s wealth , education , and health .
aside from banning bottom trawling and establishing a global fund for avoided deforestation , we should designate a global network of protected marine areas , in which fishing , boating , polluting , dredging , drilling , and other damaging activities would be prohibited .
such areas not only permit the regeneration of species , but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas .
we also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abundance and extinction , just as we now have such a process for climate change .
politicians don ’ t listen very well to individual scientists , but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice .
finally , the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow human-induced climate change .
there can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species ’ viability .
as the planet warms , and rain and storm patterns change dramatically , many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival .
some can migrate , but others ( such as polar bears ) are likely to be driven to extinction unless we take decisive action to head off climate change .
these measures are achievable by 2010 .
they are affordable , and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits .
most importantly , they would allow us to follow through on a global promise .
it is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species – and jeopardize our own future – in a fit of absent-mindedness .
new York – This week the United Nations Human Rights Council will debate the report of the fact-finding mission led by Judge Richard Goldstone on human rights violations in the Gaza conflict .
let us hope it is a full and fair examination based on the report ’ s findings and recommendations .
Goldstone and his team concluded that both Israel and Hamas , the Palestinian group controlling Gaza , committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity during the period of the conflict which the investigation addressed . the report calls for credible investigations of alleged rights violations and recommends that the UN Security Council require both sides to report back within six months on the results , including any prosecutions they will carry out in connection with the violations identified .
failure to do so , in the view of Goldstone ’ s commission , should result in the Security Council referring the matter to the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
unfortunately , rather than debating Goldstone ’ s detailed findings and the merits of his recommendations on ways to move forward , there are indications that governments may focus instead on the process leading up to the investigation and seek to limit full discussion of the report .
as someone involved in that process , I feel it is important to put my views on record , as comments I made previously are now being used as part of the effort to undermine Judge Goldstone and his important work .
I refused to accept the invitation from the president of the Human Rights Council at the time , Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi of Nigeria , to lead the investigation following the Human Rights Council ’ s January 12 , 2009 resolution . as a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , I felt strongly that the Council ’ s resolution was one-sided and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground .
it referred only to “ the grave violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks , ” and called for a mission to investigate “ all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying power , Israel , against the Palestinian people . ”
I was also aware that the UN Human Rights Council had made repeated condemnations of Israel over the past two years but had focused little attention on large-scale violations of human rights in other countries .
this pattern of action and inaction by the Council has given greater credence to those who believe the UN ’ s highest human rights body is inherently anti-Israel .
I decided I could not undertake the mission for these reasons .
I am aware that Judge Goldstone , a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate , shared similar concerns when he was initially approached .
but he was able to work with the Council ’ s president to secure an agreement he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken byboth parties to the conflict .
experts can debate whether this was in conformity with UN rules and procedures .
I have no doubt that those involved were seeking a way forward that would allow for a full investigation and help overcome the political divisiveness currently undermining the Human Rights Council within the UN system .
the question now is whether governments will give Judge Goldstone ’ s findings the serious attention they deserve , or instead fall back into an overtly political posture .
as Goldstone &apos;s report makes clear :
both the Palestinians and the Israelis are legitimately angered at the lives that they are forced to lead : for the Palestinians , the anger about individual events – the civilian casualties , injuries and destruction in Gaza following from military attacks , the blockade , the continued construction of the Wall outside of the 1967 borders – feed into an underlying anger about the continuing Israeli occupation , its daily humiliations and their as-yet-unfulfilled right to self-determination .
for the Israelis , the public statements of Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under existential threat from which only it can protect its people .
in this way , both the Israelis and the Palestinians share a secret fear – for some , a belief – that each has no intention of accepting the other ’ s right to a country of their own .
this anger and fear are unfortunately ably represented by many politicians . ( Para .

for the sake of human rights and peace in the region , my hope is that the international community will bear witness to these circumstances , consider Judge Goldstone ’ s report in its entirety and press for accountability for the most serious crimes .
accounting chicanery will be high on the agenda of the bankers who will meet at the annual IMF / World Bank gathering in Washington , D.C. The IMF should do more than offer the private sector advice about how to fix its accounting problems ; governmental accounting tricks and the IMF &apos;s own wheezes should also be addressed , says Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz .

the Arthur Anderson and Enron scandals in America have focused attention on the problems of accounting in private businesses .
but the scale of this corruption should not blind us to the problem of public sector accounting , where many deceitful things are also being done .
accounting rules are designed to provide standardized frameworks within which the financial position of a firm , or government , can be assessed .
bad accounting frameworks always lead to bad information , and bad information leads to bad decisions , with serious long term consequences .
this is true in the public as well as the private sector .
America &apos;s business scandals showed how accounting rules can be bent and abused to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a company .
the Bush Administration , not to be left behind , has shown how public accounting rules can be bent so as to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a national economy .
indeed , last year saw what may be the largest accounting fraud ever conducted , as a mega-surplus of more than $ 3trillion for the years 2002 to 2011 was transformed into a $ 2 trillion deficit .
investors in Enron waited years before discovering that something was amiss . though sudden and vast , the change in America &apos;s fiscal stance already provides a clear inkling that something was amiss .
it will be years before the full magnitude of President Bush &apos;s deception is apparent .
meanwhile , the Bush Administration will blame the sinking economy , bad luck , and unintentional miscalculations for the vanished surplus .
but America is not alone in allowing for official accounting shenanigans .
in Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world , the IMF imposes accounting frameworks that not only make little sense , but result in excessive austerity .
in some of the poorest countries in the world - ie , those most dependent on aid - the IMF has argued that foreign aid should not be listed as revenue in a government &apos;s budget calculations .
but what else is aid if it is not revenue ?
the IMF &apos;s argument seems to be this : a country cannot rely on foreign aid because aid is too unstable .
the truth , of course , is that aid is more stable than tax revenues in poor countries .
by the IMF &apos;s logic , neither aid nor tax revenues should be included in budgets .
if that is the case , every country in the world is in deep trouble .
the absurdity here is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to reserves .
but donor countries want to see the money they give to finance schools or health clinics spent on schools and health clinics ; they don &apos;t want to see it added to a nation &apos;s reserves .
governments in developing countries have thecorrect answer to the problem of revenue instability : expenditure flexibility .
build schools when you have aid ; stop building them when you don &apos;t .
for years , World Bank economists have tried to convince the IMF to see this logic , with little progress .
other IMF accounting practices , including how the capital expenditures of government-owned enterprises are treated , are also causing outrage .
if a state owned enterprisein Latin America wants to borrow to make an investment , in Latin America such borrowing is treated as an addition to the deficit .
investors , worried about the size of a government deficit , see only the bottom line .
but if a company can buy a $ 1 billion asset for $ 500 million , economic logic says buy the asset .
the balance sheet is improved by $ 500 million .
but byIMF logic , all you see in the accounts is increased expenditure and borrowing , not the value of the acquired asset .
because of this rule , investors may only see an apparent worsening of the country &apos;s fiscal position , and so may demand higher interest rates .
of course , foreign investors like this IMF logic : government corporations are put at a distinct disadvantage : their ability to invest inhibited , these firms cannot compete to make acquisitions .
a second IMF accounting distortion involves stabilization funds .
these are national funds that , in boom years , receive revenues from sales of natural resources to be set aside against a rainy day .
this makes sense .
but IMF accounting inhibits the use of these funds to help stabilize an economy through counter-cyclical fiscal spending .
according to Mexican and Chilean officials I have discussed the matter with , spending from a stabilization fund is reportedly treated as if the country is borrowing , thus adding to its deficit .
it is , of course , in times of economic downturn that countries worry most about their credit rating , so the IMF stance is particularly unhelpful .
IMF accounting frameworks , rather than providing useful signals to the market , provide distorted information that exacerbates a troubled country &apos;s problems .
good decisions requireaccurateinformation , and this comes only through good accounting frameworks .
of course , no perfect accounting framework exists , but some frameworks systematically distort .
indeed , a hidden agenda often exists in the choice of an accounting framework .
not including stock options inside the accounting framework served US corporate interests , and those of individual bosses , well .
the IMF &apos;s distorted and unfair accounting frameworks may also serve a hidden purpose : to force governments to shrink expenditures .
but there are high economic and social costs to this agenda , one that goes far beyond the IMF &apos;s mandate .
Brussels – The tsunami that has swept across financial markets is a global catastrophe .
if handled correctly , however , the crisis may yet raise the esteem of the European Union and its institutions .
the EU ’ s legitimacy problem has two different aspects : apathy , leading to a low turnout in the European parliamentary elections , and outright euro-skepticism .
the voter-turnout problem partly reflects frustration about the present state of the EU , and also people ’ s impression that they can exert little influence by voting one way or the other .
Euro-skepticism , on the other hand , and the looming threat of anti-European populism , is directly linked to the idea that the EU is not merely incapable of offering a solution to the crisis , but in fact is part of the problem .
so , although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today ’ s increasingly difficult environment , it is actually being blamed for globalization .
many people confuse these two aspects of the EU ’ s legitimacy problem , and believe that somehow turnout in European elections can be increased by pointing out to people how good and important the EU is .
but in most cases , this is not possible .
at first sight , the easiest answer to the problem of low voter turnout is to give more power to the European Parliament .
but if this was the solution , then we would not have had steadily declining turnouts since the high point of 63 % , at the first elections to the European Parliament in 1979 .
after all , since then the EP ’ s influence and powers of joint decision-making have grown constantly .
the trouble is that , EP elections must be “ about ” something if voters are to be interested , which means they must involve a real choice .
and a real choice requires Europe-wide election campaigns by all parties .
this would also involve making the choice of the European Commission ’ s president dependent on the outcome of the EP elections .
but , in fact , both of these conditions have already been met ; in 2004 , Portuguese Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso was appointed President of the Commission because he came from the political organization with the strongest election result , the European People ’ s Party .
and this year ’ s elections saw a more intensive presence of party organizations at European level than ever before .
instead , I believe that the most important way to reawaken voters ’ interest in European elections will be to open up the election of the Commission ’ s President to them , and create a genuinely Europe-wide political debate during the next election campaign .
the Euro-skepticism problem can be tackled only if the Union itself starts to perform better , and is seen to be doing so .
that is why in the aftermath of the failed referenda four years ago in France and the Netherlands on the Constitutional treaty , the Commission tried to emphasize the idea of a “ Europe of Results ” that would seek to convince citizens of its worth through concrete achievements .
given the gravity of the economic crisis , the time has come for the EU to demonstrate its strengths whenever possible .
the aim must be not only to win back the hearts of Europeans who have become skeptical , but also to convince them that the Union is indispensable to meeting the challenges Europeans face .
Europe ’ s citizens understand that the relatively small nation-states that make up the EU are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own .
in Ireland , last autumn ’ s financial crisis provoked a turnaround in public opinion about the EU , and even in Iceland , although it lies on the periphery of our continent , membership of the EU and the euro have become a priority .
European countries have become so interconnected that isolated national measures on issues like financial-market regulation are hopeless .
a changing world in which new powers like China and India play an increasingly important role will not wait for Europe to make up its mind .
the EU must instead show leadership through its efforts to solve the world ’ s current problems .
as for the European People ’ s Party , for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people .
the economic crisis was caused by shortsightedness and a lack of control in the global financial system .
now we must redefine the role of regulators in financial markets and in the wider economy , for we cannot let the financial sector walk off with the profits and leave taxpayers bearing the losses .
that doesn ’ t mean that we are advocating a move to socialism ; we want better and smarter regulation , not regulation for its own sake .
we see five keys to recovery :
new job creation must be a core priority , with reform and investment in education and life-long learning necessary to create opportunity for all ; A prolonged global economic slump must be averted , and European governments must continue to improve coordination on fiscal and monetary policies ; The international financial architecture must be rebuilt .
European regulations are not sufficient for a healthy global financial system ; The recession is an opportunity to increase investment in green technologies to make Europe less dependent on fossil fuels ; Protectionism must be prevented , within Europe and without .
Europe ’ s internal market is a success story that has indisputably created growth and jobs.A “ Europe of Results ” is achievable .
it can strengthen the EU ’ s legitimacy , though , only if policy recommendations such as these , and the successes that result from implementing them , are communicated clearly and effectively to the general public .
MILAN – Although the financial crisis is winding down , the prospects for growth in the global economy are unlikely to pick up .
this is , in part , inevitable .
but it is also the result of poor coordination between governments as the world economy rebalances .
prior to the crisis , American consumers , on average , either saved nothing or accumulated debt .
that has now changed .
with household wealth seriously damaged by the housing crash and other asset-price declines , pensions and retirement provisions are in disarray .
because asset prices will not reach pre-crisis levels anytime soon ( that is , without inflating another bubble and risking renewed instability ) , household saving in the United States has risen to about 5 % of disposable income , and probably will rise further .
this withdrawal of the US consumer is part ( perhaps half ) of the process of rebalancing the global economy .
restoring America ’ s savings-investment balance implies a reduction in global aggregate demand of around $ 800 billion .
to be sure , fiscal deficits and emergency measures in advanced economies and some major developing countries have cushioned the sharp decline , substituting in part for missing consumers .
but this substitution cannot continue indefinitely .
in advanced countries , governments will eventually be forced to reduce spending , and central banks will withdraw from emergency credit provisions and guarantees .
as a result , many believe that a “ new normal ” of slower advanced-country growth is upon us .
despite a recovery in asset prices in many countries and the deceleration of negative growth , unemployment is high and rising .
risk spreads have declined from their mid-crisis highs , but credit in many sectors remains tight or barely available , while the financial sector is set to become more conservative – and is likely to be re-regulated with higher capital , reserve , and margin requirements .
and this is just the baseline scenario .
downside risks include fiscal destabilization resulting from a failure to rein in deficits , inflation and withdrawal of central bank autonomy , and loss of confidence in the dollar , which continues to be the reserve currency for the global economy .
little wonder , then , that many knowledgeable analysts reasonably expect post-crisis growth in advanced countries to be lower , perhaps by 0.5 to 1 % .
a 1 % slowdown in advanced-country growth translates into roughly $ 350 billion of missing aggregate demand every year , in addition to the shortfall because of rebalancing in the US .
if the slowdown in advanced countries persists , pre-crisis growth levels will not be achievable in the developing world either , owing to insufficient demand to absorb the implied increase in output .
of course , individual developing countries may be spared .
but it is an unfortunate mathematical fact that not everyone can gain market share .
if the advanced-country scenario is right , many developing countries will lose out and experience sharply diminished growth .
prior to the crisis , many suspected that the mix of aggregate demand that was supporting high growth was unsustainable , though the problem perhaps seemed too hypothetical to compel collective action .
not anymore .
but the collective action problem is no less daunting , and it requires urgent attention if the world ’ s growth aspirations are to be achieved .
the problem is all the more pressing because countries can achieve gains in market share not only through higher private-sector competitiveness , but also by means of protectionist measures .
and , as we have seen in many countries ’ efforts to ameliorate the crisis , the non-cooperative protectionist response is much more likely to be adopted – despite wide recognition that it is highly destructive – when aggregate demand is in short supply .
so what can be done to shore up global aggregate demand and growth prospects , while preserving the economic openness that has benefited major parts of the developing world so greatly in the past 30 years ?
first , countries with current-account surpluses such as Germany , Japan and China must recognize that their own growth ( and that of others ) depends on reducing the global savings-investment imbalance , which will result in narrowing external deficits elsewhere .
this needs to be done on a sustained basis following the withdrawal of extraordinary fiscal stimulus .
second , everyone must recognize their stake in restoring balanced advanced-country growth as much and as soon as possible in order to counter the ongoing shortfall in aggregate demand .
after all , advanced countries account for about two-thirds of global GDP , so slow growth in these countries will inevitably impede global growth and truncate the growth potential of much of the developing world .
this challenge , however , is very complex because deleveraging and rebalancing cannot be completed overnight .
but key steps can and should be taken : restoration of fiscal balance in well-communicated plans , commitment to central bank autonomy and low inflation , and striking a thoughtful balance between under- and over-regulation of the financial sector .
Externally , major trading partners and holders of advanced-country assets can support rebalancing by agreeing to avoid sudden and potentially destabilizing shifts in the composition of their balance sheets .
so , two crucial items must claim priority at the top of the world ’ s economic agenda in the months ahead .
the first is re-regulation of advanced countries financial systems with a view to ensuring greater stability without impairing essential functions or unnecessarily elevating the cost of capital .
the second is a set of understandings and commitments among the major advanced and developing countries to rebalance the global economy in order to restore aggregate demand and growth .
if that can be accomplished , the world will have taken a major step toward a relatively smooth , effective , and equitable global economic recovery .
Copenhagen – Striking the right balance between preventing global warming and adapting to its effects is one of the most important – and most vexing – policy questions of our age .
it is also often ignored .
according to the conventional wisdom of many environmental campaigners , we should first do everything we can to mitigate global warming , and only then focus on adaptation strategies .
this seems wrong – even immoral – if we could do more for people and the planet through adaptation .
Moreover , it is inconsistent with the inescapable fact that , whatever we do , we cannot prevent all of global warming ’ s effects .
if we are ill-prepared , global warming will cause more deaths and devastation , especially in poor countries and fragile societies .
adaptation would also mean saving many lives from catastrophes not related to global warming .
if we prepare societies for more ferocious hurricanes in the future , for example , we are also helping them to cope better with today ’ s extreme weather .
there has been a huge amount of research into the ways that humans cause climate change , and how we can reduce it .
much less work has been devoted to adaptation .
it is important to acknowledge that some adaptation strategies will lead to more greenhouse-gas emissions .
responding to water scarcity by re-using and treating wastewater , or through deep-well pumping and desalination , will increase fossil-fuel use .
using more air-conditioning to cool our houses in summer will do the same – although this is vital if we want to save lives .
adaptation could allow for higher carbon emissions in another way : reducing the damage and harm that we experience from global warming , giving us more time to implement alternatives to reliance on fossil fuels .
should any of this stop us from using adaptation strategies ?
to arrive at an informed answer , we need to work out how the planet will look in 2100 if we invest different amounts in adaptation and carbon cuts .
we need to take into account the increase in emissions that adaptation will cause .
the most critical issue isn ’ t any rise or fall in emissions . it is how much climate damage we can avoid .
how much of the planet can we help by dealing with rising sea levels ?
how many lives can we spare from heat , starvation , or malaria ?
these are the real reasons we care about global warming .
reaching a proper answer to these questions requires extensive economic modeling , with different variables calculated and regional differences analyzed .
new research by three Italian economists , Francesco Bosello , Carlo Carraro , and Enrica De Cian does this , and , ultimately , provides a powerful economic case for a much greater focus on adaptation .
they first look at the different ways that climate change will affect us at mid-century .
this work is based on standard scenarios , and carries the typical caveats of predictions far into the future .
nevertheless , they find that many of our biggest concerns will turn out to be trivial , or even beneficial .
sea-level rises will be a very minor concern for every country , with the financial impact adding up to less than 0.1 % of GDP .
health problems will be negligible for all but a few nations .
and global warming ’ s impact would reduce energy consumption for almost all nations .
the important effects are on agriculture and tourism , where nations will lose , on average , about 0.5 % of GDP from each sector .
but much of this damage will be avoided by people choosing for themselves to adapt to a change in their environment .
farmers will choose plants that thrive in heat .
new houses will be designed to deal with warmer temperatures .
simple economic models , often quoted in the media , show that unconstrained global warming would cost a substantial 2 % of GDP in the rich world by the end of the century .
but this fails to acknowledge that people will change their behavior when the environment changes .
taking adaptation into account , rich countries will adapt to the negative consequences of global warming and exploit the positive changes , creating a totalpositive effect of global warming worth about 0.1 % of GDP .
poor countries will be hit harder , however .
adaptation will reduce the climate change-related losses from 5 % of GDP to slightly less than 3 % – but this is still a significant impact .
the real challenge of global warming , therefore , lies in tackling its impact on the Third World .
here , more needs to be done , above and beyond the adaptation that will happen naturally .
importantly , the new research shows that adaptation would achieve a lot more than cuts in carbon emissions .
reducing emissions to a level that does not extinguish economic growth could avert $ 3 trillion worth of damage , whereas adaptation could prevent around $ 8 trillion worth of damage .
for every dollar spent on adaptation , we would achieve about $ 1.70 worth of positive changes for the planet .
the economic case for focusing more on adaptation is clear .
the crucial next step is to ensure that economic arguments become a stronger part of our political debate about how to address global warming .
Washington , DC – Dropping bombs as a solution to the world ’ s trouble spots may be falling out of fashion ( with the notable exception of Libya ) , but finger wagging is definitely back in .
hardly a day goes by without a major newspaper somewhere in the West offering sage and specific , but often not-so-friendly , advice to distant struggling democracies on what they “ must ” do to earn the “ international community ’ s ” approbation .
of course , such advice , like much of newspapers themselves nowadays , comes free of charge .
but it is also advice that is free of responsibility , and , as Stanley Baldwin once said , power without responsibility is the prerogative of the harlot .
there is a considerable gap between offers of advice one cannot refuse and the responsibility to deal with the consequences when that advice proves wrong or extremely difficult to implement .
the world ’ s advice givers might try to keep this in mind when offering to help leaders of distant countries that are grappling with problems with which the adviser has little or no first-hand experience .
every once in a while , a profession ( most frequently , economics ) determines that it has reached a consensus on how to solve a problem .
the so-called “ Washington Consensus ” that held sway before the recent financial crisis was a good example .
in the case of nascent democracies , the formula that is now often made compulsory is this : lift all bans on political activities , liberalize the media , hold elections ( the sooner , the better ) , resolve all minority issues in favor of the minorities , abandon trade barriers , and rid the country of corruption , preferably overnight .
new governments are urged to tackle all of these problems immediately and simultaneously , lest they lose “ momentum ” and begin backsliding .
the subtext is clear : be like us now .
how to do this is left up to the new leaders , who are often credited with goodness and powers of persuasion they never had and never will have .
in many cases , the cohesiveness of opposition movements that come to power in the wake of a political upheaval may not be what the international media presume it to be .
indeed , some components of these so-called “ democratic coalitions ” may not be democratic at all .
some leaders , such as Nelson Mandela , rise to the historic occasion , against all odds .
others , such as Kazakhstan ’ s Nursultan Nazarbayev ( popular with Western media when he first came on the scene ) plainly has not .
how can we help ensure these movements ’ sustainability in such fluid moments ?
Modesty is a virtue in private life .
it should also be a guide in dispensing political advice .
I would start by keeping in mind that some countries ’ capacity to absorb advice is limited , so it should be offered in smaller portions .
where to start ?
the most important and potentially sustaining feature of a new democracy lies in its effort to commit itself to observing international human-rights standards . in fact , there is a large body of literature that indicates that even countries in the aftermath of internal conflict can reach a higher level of compliance with these standards .
but human rights should not be conflated with democracy .
while democracy is , no doubt , the form of governance that best preserves human rights , the two are not the same thing .
human rights will not co-exist with dictatorship , or with any other non-democracy , for long .
setting standards and goals of human rights is a powerful signal that a country is pointing itself in the right direction .
the country is in effect announcing that it is moving toward democratic institutional arrangements .
banning torture , complying with international standards of prisoners ’ rights , and enshrining rights of association and public assembly all immediately come to mind .
the embrace of essential human-rights standards as a cornerstone of a country ’ s development is one of our era ’ s seminal innovations .
the notion that a dictator can claim the sovereign right to abuse his people has become unacceptable .
a country that makes progress on human rights and commits to the change of behavior required to meet these international standards can also make a decisive turn toward a better future .
we should therefore focus on meeting international human-rights standards as a goal that a new democracy “ must ” ( to use a favorite word of Western editorial writers ) move toward quickly .
but we should not confuse these values with the other essential elements of progress , such as establishing liberalized trade regimes , creating institutional structures with a separation of powers , and rooting out corruption .
these are absolute necessities for democratic success , but they require longer-term development of institutional capacity .
corruption , for example , may have cultural antecedents and is part and parcel of institutional weakness .
in most cases , neither can be remedied overnight .
above all , we need to show patience with the new governments of the countries we hope to see evolving toward democracy , and avoid the tendency to expect instant gratification .
a few months of politics will never overcome a few centuries of sociology .
so , as we watch and wait , we need to be as supportive – but not overbearing – as possible .
the violence in France , fueled by staggering unemployment and ruthless policing , reflects the utter failure of the French model of social integration .
but violence elsewhere in Europe , such as the London bombings of July and the brutal murder of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh on the streets of Amsterdam in November 2004 , had already made Europe ’ s failure to integrate its minorities painfully clear .
as the riots in France fade , French politicians are agonizing about how to proceed .
forty years ago , after legal segregation of blacks and whites formally ended in America , the United States was confronted by similar problems .
America ’ s response shows , however , that integration cannot be viewed as a one-way street .
in addition to imposing demands and constraints on minorities to join the mainstream , society must be willing to demand of itself that it make room for all its citizens .
as a potential model to be followed , Europe should look at the so-called “ affirmative action ” policies that America enacted to provide opportunities to blacks .
affirmative action , or “ positive discrimination , ” as some have called these policies , began with university admissions .
but , in the early 1970 ’ s , President Richard M. Nixon expanded the scope of affirmative action .
as a result , ethnicity began to be weighed as a positive factor not only in university admissions , but also in public procurement decisions , credit facilities for small enterprises , and government hiring .
the rational for affirmative action in those early years was the fact that , after a long history of systemic injustice , merely outlawing discrimination based on race or gender would not ensure equal opportunity for all .
such programs are often viewed as contradicting a basic American value , namely that admissions , lending , and hiring decisions should be based on the merits of the individual , not group distinctions .
but they remain in existence three decades later .
indeed , leading American companies , like General Motors , General Electric , and Walmart , have created affirmative action programs for hiring and selecting suppliers at their own initiative .
similarly , anchormen and anchorwomen from all ethnic backgrounds populate American television news programs .
in France , by contrast , the appointment of the black anchorwoman Audrey Pulvar was big news on its own , because most of her colleagues in France are white .
affirmative action in the US has been effective in creating a large African-American middle class .
the percentage of black households earning over $ 50,000 a year ( adjusted for inflation ) has more than tripled over the last four decades , from 9.1 % in 1967 to 27.8 % in 2001 .
indeed , in the US , more people of color and women hold top jobs in the public and private sector than anywhere else in the world .
the fact that a large black underclass remains – something the recent floods in New Orleans revealed in a horrifically dramatic way – is mainly the result of failing school systems .
affirmative action programs , of course , have always been vulnerable to attack by those who can ’ t benefit from them .
in 2003 , a white student asked the US Supreme Court to declare that the use of race in the University of Michigan ’ s admission policies violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution .
the Supreme Court , however , ruled that the program was constitutional , citing a “ compelling state interest ” in racial diversity . “ Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civil life of our nation , ” the court said , “ is essential if the dream of one nation , indivisible , is to be realized . ”
in reaching its decision , the Supreme Court took into account a legal brief submitted by 60 major American businesses , led by General Motors , asking that affirmative action be upheld .
they argued that the skills needed in today ’ s global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to a wide diversity of people .
Retired military officers and commanders told the court that affirmative action was essential to maintaining an integrated officer corps .
what America ’ s affirmative action programs may not do is set quotas for minorities , as this prevents competition between different groups .
but , in comparing groups , it is permitted to use an individual ’ s status as member of an under-represented minority in his or her favor .
as a result , a university may select a black student with a satisfactory score on the admissions test , even if there is a white student with a better score .
from the current French viewpoint , however , laws and regulations based on ethnicity are regarded as an unwelcome encroachment on the Republican ideal .
French President Jacques Chirac vehemently opposes quotas for immigrants , out of fear that such a policy would stigmatize groups .
and French businesses don ’ t see it as their role to solve the problems of the suburbs .
Moreover , French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy hasn ’ t done much except hand out some special grants to the smartest immigrants from the suburbs .
France does have affirmative action programs , but they address poverty , not ethnicity .
if European politicians are serious about preventing a schism between population groups , affirmative action is essential – not only at the workplace , but also for small business loans , home loans , public procurement , and school admissions .
Tony Blair , who in July was faced with the shortcomings of integration in the UK , should take advantage of the country ’ s current presidency of the European Union to make affirmative action programs the top priority at next month ’ s summit of European government leaders in Brussels .
Copenhagen – Public skepticism about global warming may be growing , but the scientific consensus is as solid as ever : man-made climate change is real , and we ignore it at our peril .
but if that issue is settled ( and it should be ) , there is an equally large and important question that remains wide open : what should we do about it ?
one prescription that is bandied about with increasing frequency certainly sounds sensible : the world should drastically cut the amount of greenhouse gases that it pumps into the atmosphere each day .
specifically , we are told , the goal should be a 50 % reduction in global carbon-dioxide emissions by the middle of the century .
even its backers concede that achieving this target won ’ t be easy – and they are right .
in fact , they are so right that they are wrong .
allow me to explain .
our dependency on carbon-emitting fuels is more than enormous .
it is overwhelming .
for all the talk about solar , wind , and other hyped green-energy sources , they make up only 0.6 % of global energy consumption .
renewable energy overwhelmingly comes from often-unsustainable burning of wood and biomass by people in the Third World .
fossil fuels account for more than four-fifths of the world ’ s energy diet .
so , in order to cut global carbon emissions in half by the middle of the century , we would obviously have to start getting a lot more of our energy from sources that don ’ t emit carbon .
can we do this ?
according to the International Energy Agency , here ’ s what it would take to achieve the goal of cutting emissions by 50 % between now and mid-century :
30 new nuclear plants ; 17,000 windmills ; 400 biomass power plants ; Two hydroelectric facilities the size of China ’ s massive Three Gorges Dam ; and42 coal and gas power plants with yet-to-be-developed carbon-capture technology.Now consider this : this list does not describe what we would have to build between now and 2050 , but what we would have to build each and every year until then !
one more thing : even if we managed to do all this ( which we obviously cannot ) , the impact on global temperatures would be hardly noticeable by 2050 .
according to the best-known climate-economic model , this vast undertaking would likely wind up reducing global temperatures by just one-tenth of one degree centigrade ( one-fifth of one degree Fahrenheit ) , while holding back sea-level rises by only one centimeter ( less than half an inch ) .
that ’ s not a lot of bang for the buck .
indeed , the projected costs of this approach – some $ 5 trillion annually by mid-century – are so much greater than its likely benefits that it makes no sense to call it a solution at all .
Fortunately , there is a better , smarter way to deal with global warming .
what if , instead of spending trillions of dollars trying to build an impossible number of power plants – or , more likely , condemning billions of people around the world to continued poverty by trying to make carbon-emitting fuels too expensive to use – we devoted ourselves to making green energy cheaper ?
right now , solar panels are so expensive – about 10 times more than fossil fuels in terms of cost per unit of energy output – that only well-heeled , well-meaning ( and , usually , well-subsidized ) Westerners can afford to install them .
but think where we ’ d be if we could improve the efficiency of solar cells by a factor of ten – in other words , if we could make them cheaper than fossil fuels .
we wouldn ’ t have to force ( or subsidize ) anyone to stop burning coal and oil .
everyone , including the Chinese and the Indians , would shift to the cheaper and cleaner alternatives – and global emission targets would automatically be met .
can we achieve this technological miracle over the next 20 to 40 years ?
in a word , yes .
the price of solar energy has been dropping steadily for 30 years – by about 50 % every decade – and we could likely accelerate that decline further with sufficiently large investments in research and development .
how large ?
if we were willing to devote just 0.2 % of global GDP ( roughly $ 100 billion a year ) to green-energy R &amp; amp ; D , I believe that we could bring about game-changing breakthroughs not just for solar power , but also for a wide variety of other alternative-energy technologies .
this belief in the potential of technological progress strikes some climate activists as naïve or even delusional .
but is it really ?
consider one of the miracles of the modern age – the personal computer .
these devices didn ’ t become household items because governments subsidized purchases or forced up the price of typewriters and slide rules .
no , what happened is that , largely as a result of the space race , the United States government poured lots of money into R &amp; amp ; D for solid-state physics and electronics engineering .
the resulting breakthroughs not only got Neil Armstrong to the moon in 1969 , but also made it possible for Apple to introduce the first Mac in 1976 and IBM to debut the first PC five years later .
we can do the same for clean energy .
forget about subsidizing inefficient technologies or making fossil fuels too expensive to use .
instead , let ’ s fund the basic research that will make green energy too cheap and easy to resist .
things aren ’ t going well in Afghanistan .
sometime at the turn of 2001 / 2002 , the Bush administration concluded that the stabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan was no longer its top priority and decided to bet instead on military-led regime change in Iraq .
Afghanistan can thus rightly be seen as the first victim of the administration ’ s misguided strategy .
but the Bush administration is not the sole culprit for the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan .
it was NATO ’ s job to ensure the country ’ s stability and security , and thus NATO ’ s weak General Secretary and the European allies , especially Germany and France , share the responsibility for the worsening situation .
yet , despite all the difficulties , the situation in Afghanistan , unlike that in Iraq , is not hopeless .
there was a good reason for going to war in Afghanistan in the first place , because the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , originated there .
once undertaken , the West ’ s intervention ended an almost uninterrupted civil war , and is still viewed with approval by a majority of the population .
finally , unlike in Iraq , the intervention did not fundamentally rupture the inner structure of the Afghan state or threaten its very cohesion .
if the West pursues realistic aims , and does so with perseverance , its main objective – a stable central government that can drive back the Taliban , hold the country together and , with the help of the international community , ensure the country ’ s development – is still achievable .
there are four preconditions of the West ’ s success :
establishment of Afghan security forces strong enough to drive back the Taliban , limit drug cultivation , and create domestic stability ; willingness on the part of NATO to remain militarily engaged without any national reservations – with Germany and France in particular giving up the special conditions of their involvement ; a significant increase in development aid , especially for the so far neglected Southern part of the country ; renewal of the regional consensus reached in Bonn in 2001 , under which the reconstruction of the Afghan state was to be supported by all the parties concerned . the war in Afghanistan was never just an Afghan civil war ; rather , for decades the country has been a stage of regional conflicts and hegemonic struggles .
so , while the rebirth of the Taliban is in part due to the woefully neglected reconstruction of the Pashto Southern and Eastern part of the country , it also has external causes .
most notably , for more than two years now , Pakistan has been moving away from the Bonn consensus , betting on the rebirth of the Taliban and giving it massive support .
indeed , without Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border , and without Pakistani financial backing , the rebirth of the Taliban ’ s armed insurgency against the central Afghan government would have been impossible .
Pakistan ’ s actions are explained mainly by its strategic readjustment in light of US weakness in Iraq and the region as a whole , and by the newly strengthened relationships between India and Afghanistan , resulting in an increased Indian presence in Central Asia .
in this connection , Pakistan views the Karzai government in Kabul as unfriendly to Islamabad and a threat to its key strategic interests .
without Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border and the backing by the Pakistani intelligence service ISI , the rebirth of the Taliban ’ s armed insurgency against the central Afghan government would have been impossible .
but , by aiding the Taliban , Pakistan is playing with fire , because there are now also Pakistani Talibans who pose a threat to Pakistan .
US policy toward Pakistan is also dangerously shortsighted and reminiscent of the mistakes the US made in Iran prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution .
nevertheless , the US at least has a Pakistan policy – which is more than can be said about NATO and Europe .
in fact , it is all but incomprehensible that while the future of NATO is being decided in the Hindu Kush mountains , and while thousands of European soldiers stationed there are risking their lives , Pakistan – the key to the success or failure of the mission in Afghanistan – is not given any role in NATO ’ s plans and calculations .
part of NATO ’ s trouble stems from the fact that a number of member states insist on the right to make their own military and political decisions , and these “ national reservations ” severely limit NATO ’ s ability to act .
if NATO is to succeed , this must change without further delay .
a NATO summit , during which all members would take stock of the situation and draw the appropriate conclusions , is therefore long overdue .
the national reservations must be go , and a joint strategy for success must be adopted , including a massive increase in civilian and military aid for Afghanistan , if the country is to be prevented from descending into the same abyss as Iraq .
Moreover , a regional consensus among all the players must be rebuilt , including Pakistan , Iran , and India , whose joint responsibility for peace , stability , and redevelopment in Afghanistan must be recognized by Europe and the US .
to accomplish this , a follow-up conference to the Bonn Agreement is also required .
while the war in Iraq has been based on wishful thinking , the war in Afghanistan was necessary and unavoidable because it was there that the terrorist threat of September 11 , 2001 , originated .
it would be more than a tragedy – it would be unparalleled political folly – if , because of a lack of commitment and political foresight , the West were to squander its successes in Afghanistan .
Europe would have to pay an unacceptably high price , and NATO ’ s future would likely be jeopardized .
roughly 75 % of Afghan newborns that die do so because of lack of food , warmth , and care .
Unloved little girls fare the worst .
in Afghanistan as a whole , a woman dies of pregnancy-related causes every 27 minutes – and perhaps even more frequently , because many such deaths go unrecorded .
many , perhaps most , are under sixteen years of age .
the Taliban – blamed nowadays for just about all of Afghanistan ’ s ills – have officially been gone for nearly seven years , so why are conditions still so abysmal ?
in Kabul and Herat , mobile phones abound , a tooth-eroding concoction called “ Afghan Cola ” is sold , the Internet works ( sometimes ) , there are ATM machines , sophisticated heroin laboratories , four-wheel drive vehicles , five-star hotels , ads for private banks – all the trappings of globalized modernity .
yet so many women die like flies , in pools of blood and deep-rooted indifference .
while billions of dollars in aid have led to improvements in urban areas , where health facilities have been built and midwives trained , the overall maternal death figures have hardly changed .
as one doctor told me : “ A competent midwife or nurse would rather be out of work in Kabul than stuck in a remote village . ” But most Afghans live in remote villages – those in Badakhshan can be reached only after a day ’ s bumpy ride on a donkey .
this miserable situation has been attributed to various causes , mainly lack of infrastructure and local economic conditions .
but cultural questions must also be addressed , because gender discrimination is the most important cause of maternal mortality .
in Afghan society , discrimination begins at birth .
one obvious reason is that a boy is destined to support his parents and much of his family all his life , and therefore represents a long-term investment , whereas a girl will be given over to her husband ’ s family as soon as possible .
feeding a girl is seen as effectively looking after someone else ’ s property .
once , I heard a dreadful story of a breech birth which a traditional midwife did not know how to handle .
in the end , she wrenched the baby ’ s body out , severing it from its head , which remained inside the mother ’ s womb .
it took six days to get the woman to a hospital in Jalalabad though it was not very far from where she lived .
she somehow survived , with major health complications , including permanent fistula , which will condemn her to a life of exclusion from her family and unrelieved misery .
that tragedy can be read on many levels , each more heart-rending than the next .
but note that it occurred near a health facility .
as soon as the midwife saw that the baby was coming out feet forward , she must have known that there was little she could do to save either mother or baby .
even before that , she would have noticed that the child had not turned properly , and that major problems were on the way .
this means that someone – a husband or mother-in-law – had taken the decision not to send the young woman to the hospital , instead keeping her in inhuman suffering for nearly a week .
the solution is not just to build more hospitals , but also to change deep-rooted disdain for women .
and , sadly , things have become worse in the past 30 years , as Afghanistan ’ s particular brand of Islam , combined with its legacy of dire poverty and war , compounds an already misogynist pre-Islamic tradition .
maternal mortality is a sinister consequence of this complex situation .
the legal system , schools , and the media could bring change , but no official entity takes the problem seriously enough to initiate effective action .
the central reason is despairingly simple : women ’ s lives are not valued , and even women themselves perceive their suffering as being unavoidable .
what Afghanistan needs is an inquest after each death and laws making it a criminal offense to forbid access to medical aid , when available , to women and children ( or , more correctly , to children and their children , given that girls are often married by age 14 ) .
prisons , I fear , would be full of abusive husbands and , I regret to say , vengeful mothers-in-law .
health education through public media , reaching distant areas of the country , is an urgent priority , but has been utterly ignored in favor of commercial priorities .
questioning culture is , of course , a politically incorrect approach .
but we must refuse to bow before the altar of tolerance when it comes to what is truly unacceptable , wherever it occurs , and this is what the world is witnessing passively in Afghanistan .
does diversity authorize such brutal deaths and senseless violence against women simply because some supposedly traditional practice allows them to be married before their bodies are ready and denies them health care when they give birth ?
the fight against maternal mortality in Afghanistan must become a global priority .
ultimately , a society that allows women to be brutalized will remain a breeding ground of generalized violence .
on April 16 , more than 300 Afghani women – many of them students – marched together in Kabul in protest of a new law passed by Parliament that would impose a series of Taliban-like restrictions on women .
the law would permit marital rape , limit women ’ s movements – say , for work or study – without male permission , and even make it illegal for a woman to refuse to dress as her husband wishes .
the women , facing a crowd of furious men calling them “ whores ” and other epithets , marched two miles under a rain of abuse and delivered their petition against the law to legislators .
both houses of Parliament had approved the law , and President Hamid Karzai signed it .
the law now affects only the Shia minority , but threatens to affect pending legislation that could restrict the rights of non-Shia women as well .
when Western media sought quotes from the women , they frequently heard a Western-style feminist refrain : “ These laws would make women into a kind of property . ” In the West , the counterpoint to the notion of woman as property has been a highly individualistic demand for personal autonomy – decision-making based primarily on a woman ’ s own wishes , rather than as wife , mother , community member , or worshipper .
but , while some Western feminist insights may be useful to Afghani women and other women in the developing world as they resist certain forms of male oppression , we should not assume – as Western feminists often have – that our job is to proselytize “ our ” feminism .
on the contrary , the feminism expressed by women such as these Afghani heroines should educate us in the West about our own shortcomings .
the core theory with which emerging feminists in more traditional and religious societies are working is far different from that of Western feminism – and in some ways far more profound and humane .
in India , for example , feminists articulated to me a vision of women ’ s equality that was family-centered rather than self-centered , and that valued service to community rather than personal gratification .
they did not see their struggle as a cultural or ideological clash between men and women , but rather as a very practical effort to live free from violence and sexual assault , forced child marriage and bride-burning , and legal exclusion from parity .
the emerging consensus in India in support of greater rights and freedoms for women , while certainly causing some upheaval and adjustment ( especially within the growing middle classes ) has not yet – and might never – poison the basic trust and warmth between men and women .
nor does it seem likely to emulate the splintered , individualized , solitary society – and the commodified sexual revolution – that Western , self-based feminism reflects .
this version of feminism – the notion that women can claim equality and still have a valued role in the home , prize family above all , and view rights in the context of community and spirituality – seems like a much-needed corrective to some of Western feminism ’ s shortcomings .
Ideally , men ’ s drive for progress in the developing world would also evolve , uniting the idea of the autonomous self with support for family , community , and other ties , and Western men would learn from this as well .
Moreover , intellectually , these women remind us that Western feminism did not have to evolve the way it did , and can still change and grow to embrace a more satisfying and humane definition of equality .
Simone de Beauvoir , whose seminal bookThe Second Sex laid the groundwork for post-war Western feminism , was an Existentialist who was neither a wife nor a mother nor a woman of faith .
so her work naturally posited female freedom in a secular , solitary , and individualistic context , in which “ freedom ” means pure autonomy rather than integration within a whole – comprising family , community , and even God – on equal terms .
the good news for all women , East and West , is that President Karzai , under intense international criticism – and not just Western criticism – changed the law less than one week after the march .
this global uproar is a testament to how three decades of Western feminist challenges to leadership have changed the world for the better .
but our ( Western ) moment of feminist leadership is over now – for good reasons .
we know by now what our problems are as women in the West , and we know the blueprint for solving them .
what we lack now is not analysis , but the organizational and political will to do so .
so the leadership role is shifting to women in the developing world .
their agenda is more pressing , and their problems , frankly , far more serious than ours , which makes it much more urgent for them to develop theories appropriate to the challenges they face .
if one of those courageous Afghan women who marched in Kabul wrote – as I hope she or one of her sisters in the developing world is doing right now – the seminal text for the next 50 years on non-Western feminism , it would no doubt be equality-driven and practical .
and perhaps , in its likely view of the world as being more than the sum of consuming , competing autonomies , or gender warfare , it would be a valuable challenge to truisms that we Western feminists – and the men who love us – have thought we had to take for granted .
when NATO leaders meet for their summit in Riga at the end of this month , there will be a ghost at the feast : Afghanistan ’ s opium .
Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into the hands of terrorists , insurgents , and criminals , and the multi-billion-dollar opium trade is at the heart of the country ’ s malaise .
indeed , NATO ’ s top general , James Jones , has called drugs the “ Achilles heel ” of Afghanistan .
this year ’ s record harvest of 6,100 tons of opium will generate more than $ 3 billion in illicit revenue – equivalent to almost half of Afghanistan ’ s GDP .
profits for drug traffickers downstream will be almost 20 times that amount .
opium money is corrupting Afghan society from top to bottom .
High-level collusion enables thousands of tons of chemical precursors , needed to produce heroin , to be trucked into the country .
armed convoys transport raw opium around the country unhindered .
sometimes even army and police vehicles are involved .
guns and bribes ensure that the trucks are waved through checkpoints .
Opiates flow freely across borders into Iran , Pakistan , and other Central Asian countries .
the opium fields of wealthy landowners are untouched , because local officials are paid off .
major traffickers never come to trial because judges are bribed or intimidated .
senior government officials take their cut of opium revenues or bribes in return for keeping quiet .
Perversely , some provincial governors and government officials are themselves major players in the drug trade .
as a result , the Afghan state is at risk of takeover by a malign coalition of extremists , criminals , and opportunists .
opium is choking Afghan society .
within Afghanistan , drug addiction is rising .
neighbors that used to be transit states for drugs are now major consumers , owing to similar dramatic increases in opium and heroin addiction .
Intravenous drug use is spreading HIV / AIDS in Iran , Central Asia , and the former Soviet Union .
in traditional Western European markets , health officials should brace for a rise in the number of deaths from drug overdoses , as this year ’ s bumper opium crop will lead to higher-purity doses of heroin .
what can be done ?
first , the veil of corruption in Afghanistan must be lifted .
Afghans are fed up with arrogant and well-armed tycoons who live in mansions and drive top-of-the range Mercedes limousines – this in a country where barely 13 % of the population have electricity and most people must survive on less than $ 200 a year .
it is time for the Afghan government to name , shame , and sack corrupt officials , arrest major drug traffickers and opium landlords , and seize their assets .
donors have trained police and prosecutors and built courts and detention centers .
now it is up to the government to use the judicial system to impose the rule of law .
it will be difficult , but not impossible , to re-establish confidence in the central government .
putting major drug traffickers behind bars at the new maximum-security prison at Pul-i-Charki , near Kabul , would be a good start .
of course , Afghanistan does not bear sole responsibility for its plight .
the heroin trade would not be booming if Western governments were serious about combating drug consumption .
it is a bitter irony that the countries whose soldiers ’ lives are on the line in Afghanistan are also the biggest markets for Afghan heroin .
Furthermore , Afghanistan ’ s neighbors must do more to stop insurgents , weapons , money , and chemical precursors from flowing across their borders into the country .
coalition forces should take a more robust approach to the drug problem .
Counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics are two sides of the same coin .
improving security and the rule of law must include destroying the opium trade .
allowing opium traffickers to operate with impunity gives them a free hand to raise money to pay for the arms and fighters battling the Afghan army and NATO forces .
the United Nations Security Council has authorized the International Security Assistance Force to take all necessary measures to fulfill its mandate .
NATO troops should be given the green light to help the Afghan army fight opium – destroy the heroin labs , disband the opium bazaars , attack the opium convoys , and bring the big traders to justice .
and they should be given the tools and manpower to do the job .
there is no point in trying to win the hearts and minds of major drug traffickers .
farmers are a different story .
forced eradication risks pushing farmers into the hands of extremists , and thus will not lead to the sustainable reduction of opium fields .
indeed , as we have seen in some Andean countries , it can be counter-productive .
therefore , security and development must go hand in hand .
to achieve this , Afghanistan needs more development assistance .
international support so far has been generous , but it is still well below per capita equivalents for other post-conflict situations – and the need is much greater .
farmers will be weaned off opium over the long term only if they have sustainable livelihoods .
at the moment , Afghanistan ’ s drug lords are prospering , and rural communities are suffering .
that situation needs to be reversed .
we must punish the traffickers and reward the farmers .
we cannot afford to fail in Afghanistan .
recent history has given us graphic evidence of what would happen if we do .
but any solution in Afghanistan depends on eliminating its opium .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has declared that the two issues at the center of the G-8 Summit this July will be African poverty and global climate change .
these may seem to be distinct issues .
in fact , they are linked .
a trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why .
one morning , I was taken to a dry riverbed at the village ’ s edge .
farmers were digging a pit in the riverbed , down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level .
they explained that until recently this was a perennial river – one that flows throughout the year – but now the river stops flowing during the dry season .
only when the annual rains begin in the summer does water reappear in the river bed .
until then , water-starved communities dig for water , if they can find it and if they can afford to pump it out .
in northern Ethiopia , as in much of Africa , the rain cycle has changed markedly in recent years .
Ethiopian village life has long depended on two crops , one during a short rain in March and April , and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months .
in recent years , the short rains have failed entirely , and long rains have been erratic .
hunger is omnipresent .
perhaps half of the children are severely underweight .
much of arid sub-Saharan Africa , notably in the Sahel ( the region just south of the Sahara desert ) , has experienced a pronounced drop in rainfall over the past quarter-century .
this decline coincided with a rise in the surface temperature of the neighboring Indian Ocean , a hint that the decline in rainfall is in fact part of the longer-term process of man-made global warming .
failures of rainfall contribute not only to famines and chronic hunger , but also to the onset of violence when hungry people clash over scarce food and water .
when violence erupts in water-starved regions such as Darfur , Sudan , political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms .
if they act at all , they mobilize peacekeepers , international sanctions , and humanitarian aid .
but Darfur , like Tigre , needs a development strategy to fight hunger and drought even more than it needs peacekeepers .
soldiers cannot keep peace among desperately hungry people .
one course of action must be to help impoverished African regions to “ adapt ” to climate change and to escape the poverty trap .
Water-stressed regions like Ethiopia and Sudan can adapt , at least in part , through improved technologies such as “ drip irrigation , ” rainwater harvesting , improved water storage facilities , deep wells , and agro-forestry techniques that make best use of scarce rainfall .
better land-management practices ( the re-planting of degraded forests , for example ) can recharge underground water aquifers .
poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own .
nor should they have to .
help for poor countries in Africa and elsewhere to adapt to climate change should not be described as charity or aid , but rather as compensation for damages being imposed on the poorest people on the planet .
greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered .
in addition to adapting to climate change , the world must also reduce future risks to the planet by cutting back on emissions of greenhouse gases , which are the source of man-made climate change .
while adaptation to climate change is necessary – because it is already occurring – this is not enough .
if the world fails to mitigate future climate change , the effects of rising temperatures , increasing droughts , more numerous and severe tropical storms , rising sea levels , and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet .
the famines in Ethiopia and the violence in Darfur suggest what can lie ahead .
the best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions .
there are at least three options : shift to non-carbon energy sources such as solar or nuclear energy ; capture and dispose of the carbon dioxide emitted at carbon-based power plants ; economize on energy use , for example by shifting to hybrid automobiles and trucks .
most likely , all three of these methods will have to play a role .
the effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action , but , given the long lead times in overhauling the world ’ s energy systems , we must start now .
rich countries need to lead the way .
it is ironic that the United States , which portrays itself as a friend of democracy and impoverished countries , gives the smallest share of its GNP in aid among the rich countries , and also refuses to participate in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
this is especially ironic because African countries like Ethiopia stand steadfastly and bravely with the US in the fight for freedom and against terrorism , even as they struggle with hunger , disease , and famine .
Moreover , countries like Ethiopia are making valiant , indeed remarkable , efforts to overcome their problems , despite the lack of adequate , and long-promised , help from the world ’ s richest countries .
Africans suffering from hunger and drought , and indeed poor people everywhere , have a right to ask much more of the US and other rich countries .
Tony Blair is right to call on his rich-country colleagues to follow through on their unfulfilled promises .
I visited Ghana recently and like many others left asking : how can a &quot; developing &quot; country be developed ?
but there was something troubling about this formulation , in particular with the word &quot; developing , &quot; which is often a euphemism for theabsence of economic development .
do countries stop developing because outsiders are so intent on developing them ?
my hosts , the Kweku Hutchful Foundation , invited me with a different question in mind : how can Ghanaian leaders be developed ?
something troubled me about this formulation , too .
it was that word &quot; development &quot; again .
do we really &quot; develop &quot; leaders or countries ?
do multinational companies , international non-governmental organizations , and multilateral lenders really understand local needs ?
just because some &quot; best practice &quot; works in New York , does that mean it will work in Accra , Ghana ?
imagine how American managers would react to consultants arriving from Ghana with their &quot; best practice &quot; : &quot; it worked in Accra , so it is bound to work in New York ! &quot;
of course , there is a prominent example of just that : Kofi Annan , under whose stewardship the UN has undergone a remarkable improvement .
Annan spent most of his career outside of Ghana , and had some of his higher education in the US .
but , as one of Annan &apos;s advisors once put it , he &quot; runs the UN like an old-fashioned African village , with long discussions among the elders , periods of reflection , and eventually a decision . &quot;
of course , Annan can hardly control the UN by imposing great strategies on everyone else , as American corporate CEOs do .
but perhaps he knows better .
unlike most American CEOs , Annan was not parachuted in from outside ; he is the first career employee to lead the UN .
so he knew what was wrong and appreciated that it had to be fixed carefully and patiently , by engaging the staff rather than intimidating them .
his re-election to a second term as UN Secretary General was supported by nations all over the world , rich and poor , as well as by UN employees .
was Kofi Annan &quot; developed ? &quot;
perhaps we don &apos;t develop leaders so much as foster the conditions that bring out leadership .
if so , then a key condition must be the self-respect that comes from working things out for ourselves , individually and collectively .
this self-respect is fostered by organizations and institutions that can likewise stand on their own feet , building on the best of their own cultural traditions .
passive importation of techniques , controls , and beliefs , via agencies and experts that run around solving everyone else &apos;s problems , may be the biggest impediment to development--just another form of outside exploitation , of which Africa has had more than enough .
is it not time for indigenous development , of countries and leaders alike ?
one thing is clear .
countries like Ghana do not lack enterprise .
markets and personal initiative are pervasive .
at a red light in New York , a squeegee kid or two might approach your car ; in Accra , a stopped car is immediately surrounded by a virtual supermarket .
what Ghana and most of Africa lacks is not enterprise , butenterprises .
Micro-financing--small loans to self-employed craftspeople and the like--can help .
but development at this level may not be the problem .
the problem is the lack of indigenous enterprises incorporated beyond the efforts of individuals and small families .
instead , foreign corporations , with their funds , controls , and experts--and , just as importantly , their beliefs--dominate larger enterprise .
to be sure , foreign corporations can do good things : bring in fresh ideas , techniques , and processes , as well as capital and the scale required in some contemporary forms of manufacturing .
but nothing they do--aside from cosmetic modifications to consumer products and marketing tactics--responds to local conditions .
development as now practiced often fails because it does not build on a country &apos;s unique strengths , respect its social traditions , or foster the autonomy necessary to develop indigenous leaders and enterprises .
all too often , it isforced development , imposed against people &apos;s natural inclinations and will .
pride , dignity , and self-confidence do not figure in economic theory : they cannot be measured .
but they figure prominently in just about every story of success , whether of countries or of leaders .
how people feel about themselves , personally and collectively , greatly influences the energy with which they develop themselves .
America , for example , did not develop by depending on an imposed ideology or outside experts .
it developed through the indigenous efforts of Americans acting in their own way--assisted by extensive state intervention , through land grants to farmers , railroads , and mining companies , military spending that stimulated the economy ( and still does ) , and , of course , tariff barriers .
likewise , indigenous development played a key role in Japan and Germany after WWII , in South Korea more recently , and the UK long before .
in fact , hasany country ever developed primarily through the wholesale importation of capital , expertise , and beliefs--the equivalent of globalization today ?
for the answer to how to develop an economy , we need look no further than those economies that have developed : begin with a great deal of indigenous initiative , support it with concerted state intervention , and reinforce it with the appropriate importation of external help .
globalization must not be allowed to blind us .
Ghana certainly needs to develop economically , because material wealth is required to improve health , provide education , and sustain democracy .
but the reverse is also true : a deep-rooted sense of democracy--precisely what globalization lacks--seems necessary to support economic efforts .
the ( economically ) developed West should consider importing that lesson .
as a boy , when you join an army , you think you are going to see war as in the movies .
it &apos;s not like that .
in my first combat , I thought I was going to die , that I would never see my mother again .
it was the mid-1980s , and we were attacking a fortified garrison in western Uganda .
I was 15 years old and part of a movement that aimed to rid my country of the corrupt regime of Milton Obote , who had succeeded the murderous Idi Amin .
my leader was an inspiring , brave and talented man , Yoweri Museveni , now Uganda &apos;s President .
Museveni believed that young fighters not only needed martial skills but also a political awareness of the cause for which they fought - an end to the greed and self-delusion of Africa &apos;s post-independence leadership .
while still a teenager , I learned that the goal of war was social and political transformation .
in battle , I came to pity enemy prisoners because I had a cause to fight for and they did not .
motivated by a political agenda - renovation of my battered country - I rose through the ranks to become a trusted aide in the circle around Museveni .
in 1986 , not long after my 16th birthday , Museveni ousted Obote .
the war was over .
but not for me .
no longer a rebel but now a leader in the Ugandan army , I was sent for military training to Cuba , Libya and North Korea .
I became an expert in tank warfare .
while I hungered for an education - and even enrolled at university - I remained valuable as a soldier .
first , in my country , I helped Tutsi refugees from Rwanda , where they were a minority , fight a war against the Hutu majority there .
in the summer of 1994 , when the Hutus slaughtered the Tutsis by the hundreds of thousands , our cause grew in urgency , as did our fighting spirit .
for three years I fought alongside Tutsis , finally serving as personal aide to Paul Kagame , now Rwanda &apos;s president and his country &apos;s leading political and military strategist .
soon President Kagame asked me to fight in the Congo in order to bring an end to the monumentally corrupt regime of Mobutu .
in the Congo I led hundreds of fighters - many of them children - and helped capture pieces of the country .
in May 1997 , I even helped to capture Kinshasa and chase Mobutu from power . I had &quot; liberated &quot; a third country , and I was only 27 years old .
tired of war , the following year I turned politician , winning a seat in parliament as a member of Museveni &apos;s &quot; Movement &quot; group , the only legal party in Uganda .
last year , I began to fear that Museveni had become yet another African dictator , more concerned with power than principle .
part of my quarrel with him concerned his failure to establish a genuine multi-party democracy ; also , I objected to mounting corruption .
the World Bank and other foreign donors supply half of the Ugandan government &apos;s budget , but a third of the money is wasted on senseless military actions such as Uganda &apos;s invasion of the Congo .
Museveni holds ultimate responsibility for this corruption .
I defected to a new opposition party and campaigned on behalf of Museveni &apos;s opponent in last year &apos;s presidential election .
even though Museveni faced no risk of losing , he took no chances , arresting his opponent &apos;s aids and supporters .
though I had fought faithfully in Museveni &apos;s army as a child , I was now an adult and a critic , so he arrested me too .
tortured by my own brother ( Museveni &apos;s chief of internal security ) , I was released after local and international pressure , and I left Uganda for Britain .
in tranquil London , I now contemplate my life as a child soldier .
I have no regrets , I offer no apologies .
yet I am aware of how human rights advocates deplore the enlistment of youth into Africa &apos;s wars , where the lives of many children are ruined .
injustice provokes children to pick up guns .
so does poverty .
in parts of Africa , poverty means that youth look at guns as a way of earning a living .
powerless politically and economically , some children feel that they can only assert themselves by joining an army .
in Uganda , and in most other sub-Saharan countries , more than 40 % of the population is under the age of 15 .
every country groans under the burden of educating , employing and absorbing so many young people .
of course , no child should go to war .
but condemning child soldiers won &apos;t make them go away .
only education will .
African youth must be introduced to democracy and pacifism in the classroom .
when a child picks up a gun , he becomes a man and inspires fear , if not respect .
in my experience , African youth are forgotten except when politicians need them for battle .
if African youth are given a better education and the means to influence their communities , then they will be less likely to be used as cannon-fodder , less likely to pick up a gun , and more likely to read a book .
Seventeen years ago , against the wishes of my father , I picked up a gun , hoping to change the world .
I survived and learned .
I learned the limits of the gun .
many of my comrades were robbed of that chance , for few remain alive .
of those living , most hold senior posts in the Ugandan army ; a few are in politics .
yet most died in combat or of AIDS .
young Africans should remember this when they look for ways to make their mark .
one side effect of the American / British occupation of Iraq is that it sparked public debate on a dark secret of international finance : the debts taken on by odious regimes .
as Iraq &apos;s new rulers debate what to do about the billions of dollars in foreign debts inherited from Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime , voices ranging from the charity Oxfam-International to US defence guru Richard Perle are calling for debt repudiation on the grounds that the debts Iraq now bears were contracted to sustain a corrupt , oppressive regime .
Iraq is not the only country burdened by such debts .
across sub-Saharan Africa , many of the world &apos;s poorest people struggle with the crippling legacy of profligate lending to corrupt , oppressive rulers .
during his 32-year dictatorship , Congo &apos;s former president Joseph Mobutu accumulated a personal fortune estimated at $ 4 billion , while his government ran up a $ 12 billion foreign debt .
more of the same in Angola , where last year an IMF investigation revealed that $ 4 billion disappeared from Angola &apos;s treasury over the past five years .
it so happens that the Angolan government borrowed a similar sum from private banks in this period , mortgaging future oil revenues as security .
much of Africa &apos;s ill-gotten wealth is now stashed abroad .
in a study of 30 sub-Saharan African countries , we estimate that total capital flight for the period 1970-1996 amounted to $ 187 billion .
adding imputed interest earnings , the stock of Africa &apos;s capital flight stood at $ 274 billion - a sum equivalent to 145 % of the debts owed by those countries .
in other words , sub-Saharan Africa is a net creditor to the rest of the world : its external assets exceed its external debts .
the difference is that the assets are private and the debts public .
statistical analysis reveals that roughly 80 cents on every dollar borrowed by African countries flowed back as capital flight in the same year .
foreign borrowing and capital flight were connected by a financial revolving door , as funds borrowed in the name of governments were captured by politically connected individuals and channeled overseas as their private wealth .
Moreover , every dollar added to a country &apos;s total debt generated 3 to 4 cents of extra capital flight per year in subsequent years , implying that capital flight was partly a response to the deteriorating economic environment associated with rising debt burdens .
in the last decade , sub-Saharan Africa recorded a &quot; net transfer &quot; ( new borrowing minus debt service on past loans ) ofnegative $ 11 billion .
that is , more money flowed out of Africa to creditors than returned as fresh lending .
the countries of the region spend more on debt service than on health .
despite this haemorrhage , the debt burden grows ever larger .
but there is a remedy at hand .
the doctrine of &quot; odious debt &quot; dates from the end of the 19th century , when the US government repudiated Cuba &apos;s external debt after seizing the island in the Spanish-American war .
America &apos;s authorities argued that Cuba &apos;s debt had not been incurred for the benefit of the Cuban people , nor with their consent , and that foreign loans helped to finance their oppression .
similar reasoning can be applied today not only to Iraq , but to Africa as well .
properly functioning financial markets require creditors to bear the consequences of imprudent lending .
the notion that lenders should always be repaid , regardless of how and to whom they lend , is indefensible .
the logic of sound banking tells us that current and future African governments should accept liability only for those portions of public debts that were incurred to financebona fide domestic investment or public consumption .
Invoking the doctrine of odious debt , they could selectively repudiate that portion of the debt for which no such uses can be demonstrated .
this policy poses two practical problems .
the first is to determine who should bear the burden of proof in identifying which debts are &quot; odious . &quot;
given the evidence of widespread capital flight fueled by external borrowing , African governments can rightly insist that creditors have the responsibility of establishing that their loans were used forbona fidepurposes .
if the fate of borrowed money cannot be traced , then they must infer that it was diverted into private pockets .
the second problem is that creditors may withhold new lending from governments that have the nerve to reject odious debts .
but today resources flow from Africa to creditors , rather than the reverse .
in the short run , African countries will save money by staunching this outflow .
in the long run , selective repudiation of odious debts will benefit both borrowers and creditors by promoting more responsible lending practices .
if Iraq &apos;s occupation gives impetus to legal challenges that free Africans from the burden of odious debts , then the war will have succeeded in dismantling at least one weapon of mass destruction .
Nairobi – When I met Eunice Wangari at a Nairobi coffee shop recently , I was surprised to hear her on her mobile phone , insistently asking her mother about the progress of a corn field in her home village , hours away from the big city .
a nurse , Wangari counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land – for more farming .
even though Wangari lives in Kenya ’ s capital , she is able to reap hundreds of dollars a year in profit from cash crops grown with the help of relatives .
her initial stake – drawn from her nursing wages of about $ 350 a month – has long since been recovered .
Wangari is one of thousands of urban workers in Kenya – and one of hundreds of thousands , even millions , across Africa – who are increasing their incomes through absentee agriculture .
with prices for basic foodstuffs at their highest levels in decades , many urbanites feel well rewarded by farming .
absentee agriculture also bolsters national pride – and pride in traditional diets – by specializing in vegetables specific to the region . “ For too long our country has been flooded with imported food and Westernized foods , ” Wangari says .
“ This is our time to fight back – and grow our own . ”
across Africa , political leaders , long dismissive of rural concerns , have awakened to the importance of agriculture and the role that educated people , even those living in major cities , can play in farming .
in Nigeria , former President Olusegun Obasanjo has a huge diversified farm and has pushed for policies to help absentee farmers prosper .
in Uganda , Vice President Gilbert Bukenya routinely travels the country , promoting higher-value farming , such as dairy production .
perhaps the most visible political support for absentee agriculture is in Liberia , a small West African country where civil war destroyed agriculture , rendering the population dependent on food imports , even today .
President Johnson-Sirleaf , recognizing that educated people could contribute much to an agriculture revival , launched her “ Back to the Soil ” campaign in June 2008 in large part to encourage urban dwellers to farm .
to be sure , absentee farming by elites and educated urban workers can ’ t solve all of Africa ’ s urgent food needs .
Moreover , absentee farmers face unexpected problems .
because they don ’ t visit their fields often , they rely heavily on relatives and friends . when I decided to farm wheat for the first time this spring on leased land in my childhood village , my mother agreed to supervise plowing , planting , and harvesting .
without her help , I might not have farmed at all .
even with mother ’ s help , I have worries .
although I grew up around wheat fields , my knowledge of farming is thin .
fertilizer and spraying were both more expensive than I thought .
while my wheat stalks are sprouting on schedule , I now fear that at harvest time – in November – prices will fall and I won ’ t recoup my costs .
one key tool is the mobile phone .
my hopes for success are buoyed by my ability to call my mother inexpensively and discuss the farm .
we even decided over the phone what kind of pesticide to use and which tractor company to hire .
because they know both the tastes of fellow city dwellers and rural conditions , many urban farmers are succeeding .
in fact , some city dwellers don ’ t even bother with acquiring land or gaining distant help .
certain crops can be grown in their own homes .
James Memusi , an accountant , grows mushrooms in a spare bedroom , selling them to nearby hotels and supermarkets .
nevertheless , most people living in Africa ’ s cities have access to land in the countryside , which is why Liberia ’ s government rightly highlights the potential for farm expansion .
in a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer , the authorities declared , “ The soil is a bank ; invest in it . ”
in Liberia , the main push is to reduce imports of staples such as rice and tomatoes .
in more prosperous countries , African elites are motivated by a complex interplay of national pride , dietary concerns , and the pursuit of profit .
in Zambia , for example , Sylva Banda ignited a craze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants .
now , ordinary Lusakans want to cook similar meals in their own homes , driving demand for farmers who produce such delicacies as dried pumpkin , “ black jack ” leaves , and fresh Okra .
similarly , in Nairobi , Miringo Kinyanjui , another woman entrepreneur , is supplying unrefined – and more nutritious – maize and wheat flour .
in another move to distinguish her ingredients from Western versions , Kinyanjui also sells through grocery stores flour flavored with Amarathan , a green vegetable that grows around Kenya .
the revival of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations .
last year , Unilever ’ s Kenyan branch ran a “ taste our culture ” campaign in support of its line of traditional East African herbs and spices .
such campaigns go hand-in-hand with expanded farming , because sellers of these foods prefer nearby growers – even if these growers increasingly live in the city .
human migration is as old as history .
even migration to distant places and remote cultures is nothing new .
in the nineteenth century , millions of Europeans sought liberty and prosperity in the Americas , notably in the United States .
what is new today is the scale of migration , often across huge cultural divides - and often without a definite aim .
the African boat people in the Mediterranean are often not even sure whether they want to be in Italy , Germany , or Britain .
even those who are certain , like North Africans in Spain and France , or Turks in Germany , had as their priority escaping the hopelessness of their home countries , not arriving at a particular destination .
this modern form of migration raises massive problems for countries on the receiving end .
in Europe , it is probably the most serious social issue today , because no one has a clear idea about how to manage the resulting clash of cultures .
once upon a time , North America , notably the US , seemed to provide the answer .
it was that of the &quot; melting pot &quot; : different peoples made their own contribution to American culture , but , above all , they made every effort to accept what they found and integrate . &quot; no , &quot; the Russian woman who came to the US in the early twentieth century replied to the grandchild who asked whether her ancestors arrived with the Pilgrims on the Mayflower .
&quot; our ship had a different name , but now we are all Americans . &quot;
more recently , this has changed , giving rise to a process described by Arthur Schlesinger , the historian and former aide to President John F. Kennedy , in his bookThe Disuniting of America .
no longer are all US citizens Americans .
they have become hyphenated Americans : Italian-Americans , African-Americans , Hispanic-Americans , and so on .
the ingredients of the melting pot are separating .
even in Israel , the last true immigration country - at least for Jews - assimilation is no longer so easy .
recent newcomers from Russia have their own political party , and old Europeans have become a distinct minority .
Israel and America continue to have mechanisms to integrate new migrants .
language is an important underlying factor , and in Israel , there is the army , while in America , the values embodied in the Constitution still represent a shared secular faith .
but these mechanisms are weakening everywhere , and are virtually non-existent in European countries .
modern societies are characterized by acute problems of belonging .
they don &apos;t offer the implicit , unconscious ties of community that citizens felt in the past .
as a result , people have begun to cling to other , more primordial group identities .
they resist assimilation , fearing that it will rob them of their identity without offering a new one .
what then is the alternative to assimilation ? the &quot; salad bowl &quot; of so-called multiculturalism is no real alternative , because it does not provide the necessary glue that binds communities together .
all the ingredients remain separate from the outset .
the only viable alternative for which there are examples is probably that of London or New York .
the main characteristic of this alternative is the coexistence of a common public sphere shared by all and a considerable degree of cultural separation in the &quot; private &quot; sphere , notably in residential areas .
the public space is multicultural in terms of people &apos;s backgrounds , but is governed by agreed values , even a common language , whereas the people &apos;s private lives are - to use an ugly word - ghettoized .
in theory , this is a distinctly second-best solution to the cultural consequences of migration ; in practice it is the best answer we have .
but it cannot be had for nothing .
even the necessary minimum of a common language requires a deliberate effort , to say nothing of certain rules of behavior .
living in London , I marvel at the way in which we Londoners have come to terms with Indian family shops and West Indian-run public transport , while not asking many questions about whole districts that are Bangladeshi or Chinese .
no one has yet found a name for this new version of the &quot; separate but equal &quot; doctrine that some of us fought so hard against in the 1960 &apos;s : separate private lives in a common public space that is equal for all .
this is clearly easier in London and New York than it is in smaller towns or even in the capitals of countries where the world language of English is not spoken .
Berlin &apos;s Turkish community and the North African communities around Paris seem increasingly separate , with their own public sphere and often language .
where this happens , an explosive condition can arise , a kind of separatism within , not by historically separate groups but by newcomers against natives .
if we are forced to abandon the hope of assimilation , our efforts should concentrate on creating a public space to which all contribute and that all enjoy .
Ideally , this should be an expanding public space , for in the end , the element of unity in a modern society is the guarantee of its citizens &apos; liberty .
new YORK – This year ’ s annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund made clear that Europe and the international community remain rudderless when it comes to economic policy .
financial leaders , from finance ministers to leaders of private financial institutions , reiterated the current mantra : the crisis countries have to get their houses in order , reduce their deficits , bring down their national debts , undertake structural reforms , and promote growth .
confidence , it was repeatedly said , needs to be restored .
it is a little precious to hear such pontifications from those who , at the helm of central banks , finance ministries , and private banks , steered the global financial system to the brink of ruin – and created the ongoing mess .
worse , seldom is it explained how to square the circle .
how can confidence be restored as the crisis economies plunge into recession ?
how can growth be revived when austerity will almost surely mean a further decrease in aggregate demand , sending output and employment even lower ?
this we should know by now : markets on their own are not stable .
not only do they repeatedly generate destabilizing asset bubbles , but , when demand weakens , forces that exacerbate the downturn come into play .
unemployment , and fear that it will spread , drives down wages , incomes , and consumption – and thus total demand .
Decreased rates of household formation – young Americans , for example , are increasingly moving back in with their parents – depress housing prices , leading to still more foreclosures .
states with balanced-budget frameworks are forced to cut spending as tax revenues fall – an automatic destabilizer that Europe seems mindlessly bent on adopting .
there are alternative strategies .
some countries , like Germany , have room for fiscal maneuver .
using it for investment would enhance long-term growth , with positive spillovers to the rest of Europe .
a long-recognized principle is that balanced expansion of taxes and spending stimulates the economy ; if the program is well designed ( taxes at the top , combined with spending on education ) , the increase in GDP and employment can be significant .
Europe as a whole is not in bad fiscal shape ; its debt-to-GDP ratio compares favorably with that of the United States .
if each US state were totally responsible for its own budget , including paying all unemployment benefits , America , too , would be in fiscal crisis .
the lesson is obvious : &amp; # 160 ; the whole is more than the sum of its parts .
if Europe – particularly the European Central Bank – were to borrow , and re-lend the proceeds , the costs of servicing Europe ’ s debt would fall , creating room for the kinds of expenditure that would promote growth and employment .
there are already institutions within Europe , such as the European Investment Bank , that could help finance needed investments in the cash-starved economies .
the EIB should expand its lending .
there need to be increased funds available to support small and medium-size enterprises – the main source of job creation in all economies – which is especially important , given that credit contraction by banks hits these enterprises especially hard .
Europe ’ s single-minded focus on austerity is a result of a misdiagnosis of its problems .
Greece overspent , but Spain and Ireland had fiscal surpluses and low debt-to-GDP ratios before the crisis .
giving lectures about fiscal prudence is beside the point .
taking the lectures seriously – &amp; # 160 ; even adopting tight budget frameworks – &amp; # 160 ; can be counterproductive .
regardless of whether Europe ’ s problems are temporary or fundamental – the eurozone , for example , is far from an “ optimal ” currency area , and tax competition in a free-trade and free-migration area can erode a viable state – austerity will make matters worse .
the consequences of Europe ’ s rush to austerity will be long-lasting and possibly severe .
if the euro survives , it will come at the price of high unemployment and enormous suffering , especially in the crisis countries .
and the crisis itself almost surely will spread .
Firewalls won ’ t work , if kerosene is simultaneously thrown on the fire , as Europe seems committed to doing : there is no example of a large economy – and Europe is the world ’ s largest – recovering as a result of austerity .
as a result , society ’ s most valuable asset , its human capital , is being wasted and even destroyed .
young people who are long deprived of a decent job – and youth unemployment in some countries is approaching or exceeding 50 % , and has been unacceptably high since 2008 – become alienated .
when they eventually find work , it will be at a much lower wage .
normally , youth is a time when skills get built up ; now , it is a time when they atrophy .
so many economies are vulnerable to natural disasters – earthquakes , floods , typhoons , hurricanes , tsunamis – &amp; # 160 ; that adding a man-made disaster is all the more tragic .
but that is what Europe is doing .
indeed , its leaders ’ willful ignorance of the lessons of the past is criminal .
the pain that Europe , especially its poor and young , is suffering is unnecessary .
Fortunately , there is an alternative .
but delay in grasping it will be very costly , and Europe is running out of time .
Kiev : Chernobyl , the world ’ s most notorious nuclear power plant , will be shut down today , fourteen years after it spewed clouds of radioactive dust into the atmosphere .
back then , Ukraine became the focus of global attention , but Ukrainians learned of the disaster much later than the rest of the world .
I recall that fateful Saturday afternoon with utter clarity , strolling through Kiev with my six-year-old daughter , oblivious to the danger .
Chernobyl changed Ukraine forever , and was a catalyst for the downfall of the Soviet Union .
ultimately , Chernobyl changed the world .
now that Chernobyl will be permanently shut down , world attention again turns to Ukraine , this time in hope , not fear .
Shutting down a vital source of electrical energy , which Chernobyl remains , is no an easy task , particularly with winter upon us .
Ukraine ’ s energy infrastructure is weak ; losing 8-10 % of our electricity production and $ 100 million in revenues will strain the system even more .
we also bear the responsibilities involved in laying off Chernobyl ’ s workers and depriving the adjacent city of Slavutych ( population 28,000 ) , of its main source of income .
Moreover , we must continue dealing with the technical and ecological issues surrounding the Chernobyl sarcophagus , as well as maintain nuclear safety in the remaining nuclear plants in operation in Ukraine , including what is left of Chernobyl .
in recent years , Ukraine alone financed all the costs of dealing with the Chernobyl disaster , consistently spending 5-10 % of our state budget revenues to this end .
dealing with the aftermath of the disaster will remain a financial burden even with the plant closed .
yet closing the plant proves that we keep our promises .
we committed to shut down Chernobyl this year in an agreement with the G-7 countries and the European Commission .
closure of the last remaining reactor at Chernobyl , I believe , must mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation with the European Union and G-7 countries .
closing Chernobyl may be the most dramatic , but it is only a single episode in our reform efforts .
when we gained independence , the world expected great things from Ukraine .
over the course of a decade , the world appeared to forget about us .
now we finally have a chance to break out of the downward spiral of economic decline .
at long last , our society and economy are set on the path to growth and development .
after pro-reform forces secured victory in last year ’ s presidential elections , all of the branches of government began cooperating to entrench democracy and the market economy in Ukraine .
for the first time since independence , Ukraine recorded growth in industrial output of 12.5 % in the first 11 months of 2000 , and GDP has grown by 5.4 % this year .
tough decisions were made , not least involving the energy sector .
barter payments , -- which stifled the energy market -- were eliminated . so too tax breaks and other privileges that skewed the playing field in favor of a select few .
we are also doing everything possible to make Ukraine attractive to foreign investors .
in the energy sector , we are privatizing state-owned energy distributors .
to ensure complete transparency in the tender process , and eliminate problems experienced in the past , Western advisors are assisting us .
for our intention is to attract large Western energy companies with experience in this field as strategic investors .
ten leading international energy companies , indeed , will participate in the privatization of the first group of companies .
by the end of next year , we will privatize 12 additional energy companies .
in its sheer scale , this may be the largest single energy privatization ever attempted in Europe .
our energy companies service a territory the size of France ; they will all be privatized .
of course , these reforms are resisted , primarily by the oligarchs who thrive on a lack of transparency and use privileged access to state resources to enhance their business interests .
by eliminating barter and requiring monetary payment , we curtailed their opportunities to profit at the state ’ s expense .
although we can and will continue the fight against corruption , we cannot do everything alone .
international support for our efforts is crucial .
a positive sign here is the recent decision by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) to provide $ 215 million to complete the nuclear power stations at Rivne and Khmelnytsky , which will compensate for the loss of Chernobyl ’ s generating capacity .
Euroatom is also helping with a loan of $ 585 million to finance repairs at Ukraine ’ s functioning nuclear power plants .
in return , Ukraine will uphold its end of the deal : in addition to closing Chernobyl , we will introduce Western nuclear safety standards and renew cooperation with the IMF via the Extended Fund Facility program .
we still need other potential creditors to confirm their involvement .
closing Chernobyl will not eliminate the Chernobyl threat .
our people will be unable to live on thousands of acres of contaminated earth for hundreds of years .
the concrete sarcophagus built over the destroyed reactor must be renovated .
we are grateful to all the donor countries who , with contributions from our own state budget , helped raise the $ 760 million needed to make the sarcophagus safer .
in the end , Chernobyl ’ s legacy does not belong solely to Ukraine , for ours is a country located in the heart of Europe .
we are a European nation .
we realize that no one will implement reforms for us .
the West can , however , help speed up and facilitate our efforts , as it did with the closure of Chernobyl .
cooperation between Ukraine and the West , without a disaster to concentrate everyone ’ s minds , will benefit all concerned .
Beijing : China has now finished celebrating the 50th anniversary of Mao &apos;s revolution , but the hangover cure that so many people in the West have been urging upon the country -- a healthy dose of devaluation -- is unlikely to be swallowed .
instead , the government has put forward a fresh round of fiscal stimulation , including a RMB60 billion new bond issue and the introduction of a new 20 % tax on the interest on savings .
devaluation , indeed , remains a taboo .
why are China &apos;s leaders so adamant against devaluing the RMB ?
first , Prime Minister Zhu Rongi and his advisors are very uncertain about the short-run benefits to be gained from any devaluation .
any boost to competitiveness , for example , is likely to be small and brief , as over 50 % of China &apos;s exports are part of re-export industries using a great deal of imported materials or semi-finished goods .
for these sectors , devaluation means an increase in costs , rather than a gain in competitiveness .
Secondly , devaluation of the RMB may incite tit-for-tat retaliation by other Asian economies .
the decline of China &apos;s exports have been mainly caused by a 20 % decrease in exports to other Asian markets since 1998 .
but as these regional economies are now starting to recover , China &apos;s exports to them are starting to grow .
although a devaluation of the RMB may not have as much impact on the regional markets as before , it is impossible to calculate what way may deliver higher export growth : devaluation or not disturbing the region &apos;s increasing stabilization .
doing nothing seems the safer bet .
Moreover , devaluation will impose heavy burdens on China , for example , it will certainly increase the cost of servicing China &apos;s debts and may also worsen the overall balance of payment .
the only foreseeable benefit to be gained through a devaluation is a reduction in uncertainty as an end will be put to the rampant speculation on when the RMB will be devalued .
this may help to increase the foreign investment and reduce the capital flights .
today , the real issue for China is not devaluation but &quot; de-pegging &quot; – ie , a return to the former &quot; managed float regime &quot; of foreign exchange that prevailed between 1994 and 1997 -- which means giving up the de facto fixed-rate regime which actually pegs the RMB to the US dollar .
such a break is the only way to prevent over-speculation in the RMB , although de-pegging may cause some initial devaluation under current market conditions .
but the question is : when and how ?
the world-wide dilemma over exchange rate management is that when market pressure is not high necessary changes no longer seem so urgent .
people lack the determination to take the action .
but when pressure is high , government leaders charged with financial management feel trapped in a corner during any currency crisis .
for Chinese policy makers , today &apos;s market pressures are not high enough to force them to take action , as China still enjoys a decent surplus in its balance of payments , both on current account and capital account .
in addition , China &apos;s foreign reserve are rising at an accelerating path in recent months , up to $ 150 billion at the end of July , 1999 .
last but not the least as a reason not to devalue , China is struggling with deflation and a slowdown in the country &apos;s growth rate .
this is mainly caused by domestic problems ( the bloated state owned enterprises and the government &apos;s failure to reform them , the huge number of non-performing loans on the books of state banks , restrictions to private investment , among many other causes . external conditions are playing little part in China &apos;s slowdown .
so devaluation is unlikely to be effective in boosting the overall rate of growth .
in any case , devaluation of the RMB in real terms or in terms of competitiveness in relationship with major Asian currencies has been already been occurring over recent months : all Asian currencies , including the Japanese yen , are appreciating ; and domestic prices continue to deflate .
if the US dollar weakens in relation with other major currencies , China may not need to adjust RMB &apos;s nominal rate for quite a while .
sun Tzu and other Chinese military theorists long ago counseled that doing nothing is sometimes the best way to win in the end .
today &apos;s Chinese leadership has adopted that bit ancient wisdom to currency management .
the Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far .
now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations , including large emitters , in conversations about what to do after the treaty ’ s expiration in 2012 .
this is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era , which will be discussed by the European Council next March .
while the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries – 5.2 % between 2008-2012 relative to 1990 levels , with varying targets for individual countries – real progress can be made in sustaining development efforts and preserving our planet .
but first , all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning , and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy , infrastructure , and transport .
in other words , we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security .
at the end of the day , the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system , an incentives system , and investments in technology change .
increasingly , adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding .
dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive , but complementary .
looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change .
nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth ’ s temperature , and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level .
this would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies – a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships .
up to now , with only 15 % of the world ’ s population , rich countries have been responsible for more than 75 % of global carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions , and thus most of the environmental damage .
however , it is the developing countries – and thus the world ’ s poor – who are most vulnerable .
it is unrealistic to ask poor countries , where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies , to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change .
working with partners , the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change .
to date , over $ 1 billion dollars in Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) grants , together with about $ 8 billion in co-financing , have been committed to programs related to climate change .
while the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading , interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future .
without a regulatory framework beyond 2012 , the window of opportunity for initiating project-based transactions will close by 2006 / 2007 .
given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions , project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context .
developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-7 years from identification , through licensing , financing , and construction , and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions .
therefore , projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007 .
the World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool , and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market .
the Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries , helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities .
but , without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 , the carbon market will remain uncertain , and the private sector – vital to the market ’ s success – is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way .
according to a recent World Bank-supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance , only one in five respondents declared that they were interested in buying post-2012 emissions reductions .
now is the chance to look forward and enlist the global community – with no exclusions , although with differentiated responsibilities – in the pursuit of a more secure world , one that avoids the dire risks of environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction .
two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results .
Latin America , the region that tried hardest to implement the &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; recipes--free trade , price deregulation , and privatization--has experienced low and volatile growth , with widening inequalities .
among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990 .
in Sub-Saharan Africa , most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank .
the few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers--and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism .
China , Vietnam , India : all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook , even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction .
it is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus .
but the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development , without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint , supposedly right for all countries at all times .
the record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies : an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term , and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks .
the key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy .
encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work .
an effective strategy must accomplish two tasks : encourage investment in non-traditional areas , and weed out projects and investments that fail .
for this , governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick .
learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development .
the carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering , for example , that cut flowers , or soccer balls , or computer software can be produced at low cost , because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs .
the entrepreneur who makes the initial &quot; discovery &quot; can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates , as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him .
consequently , entrepreneurship of this type--learning what can be produced--will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives .
in turn , the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments .
implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country , depending on administrative capacity , the prevailing incentive regime , the flexibility of the fiscal system , the degree of sophistication of the financial sector , and the underlying political economy .
Time-bound subsidy schemes , public venture funds , and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented , but there are many others .
no single instrument will work everywhere .
governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources .
the job can be done , but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship .
it also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks :
Market-creating institutions ( for property rights and contract enforcement ) ;
Market-regulating institutions ( for externalities , economies of scale , and information about companies ) ;
Market-stabilizing institutions ( for monetary and fiscal management ) ;
Market-legitimizing institutions ( for social protection and insurance ) .
building and solidifying these institutions , however , takes time . using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on .
a key point here is that institutional arrangements are , by necessity , country-specific .
discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation .
after all , institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate .
reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others .
such specificity helps explain why successful countries--China , India , South Korea , and Taiwan , among others--usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies .
it also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America , Western Europe , and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector , the legal system , corporate governance , financial markets , labor markets , and social insurance .
while economic analysis can help in making institutional choices , there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice .
in fact , we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the &quot; menu &quot; of possible institutional arrangements in each area .
designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies .
it is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes .
but it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted , relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform .
adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it .
neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy .
in both cases , it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other .
critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse .
new YORK – It has become popular to suggest that when the dust settles from the global financial crisis , it may become clear that the United States-led post-war world has come to an end .
if so , the global system that has secured peace , security , openness , and economic growth over the past six decades could be in grave danger .
inspired by American leadership since World War II ’ s end , Europe , then Japan , then much of Asia and the world rose to new levels of prosperity ; the world economy globalized upon the foundation of international institutions , norms , and standards ; and foreign students educated in American universities returned home with new ideas about free markets , entrepreneurship , and democracy .
the US military ’ s protective umbrella gave large swaths of the world a vacation from war , making it easier for them to focus on economic growth and regional integration .
America not only took the lead role in building the institutions of a globalizing world – the United Nations , World Bank , IMF , NATO – it also became the model that many other countries looked to for inspiration .
after eight years of compromised American leadership , a botched war of choice in Iraq , failure to take the lead in global efforts to address climate change , Abu Ghraib , Guantánamo Bay , running up a $ 10 trillion debt , and igniting a global financial crisis – America ’ s once-glittering model has lost a good deal of its luster and America ’ s leadership has been questioned by many .
the point was driven home at the 7th Asia-Europe Meeting ( ASEM ) in Beijing this autumn , where European and Asian leaders began exploring ideas for a new global financial structure .
for much of the past 60 years , it would have been impossible to hold such a fundamental dialogue without US participation .
today , it is almost becoming a new global norm that neither the international committee nor the US is prepared for .
despite talk about American decline , the world is not prepared for a post-American era .
as irksome as some of America ’ s actions have been , particularly over the past eight years , America remains the world ’ s most critical champion of the progressive values that have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty and political repression .
if the US were to play a relatively smaller role in world affairs , and no other system was created to pick up the slack , these values could be at risk .
although many states now hide behind an alleged universal principle of inviolable state sovereignty , for example , would the international community really want to go back to the old model where states did whatever they wanted to their citizens within the confines of their own borders ?
do countries around the world believe that they will be better off if the global trade system breaks down or international shipping lanes become less secure ?
are countries like China willing to step up and pay their fair share of dues to keep the UN running ( China currently pays 2.1 % of UN dues , compared to more than 25 % for the US ) , or to capitalize revised international financial institutions or the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria in a meaningful way ?
unless other countries become more willing to step forward for the common good , a post-American world could quickly become a far more frightening environment than what it would replace .
to make its case for a continued global leadership role , America must , however , step up to the plate . while the go-it-alone impulse of the Bush administration has been discredited by its consequences , the inverse lessons regarding how important collaborative action is in today ’ s interconnected world are still being learned .
even at the apex of American power , America ’ s greatness was always based on inspiring others , and the opportunities for building market share in that particular category remain unlimited .
it is impossible to overestimate how significant a step Barack Obama ’ s election is in this direction , but America ’ s actions over the coming years will be the ultimate determinant of whether the power of America ’ s model can be restored .
America can and should , for example , become the global leader combating climate change through major investments in alternative energy , conservation , and energy efficiency , and by taking strong actions at home to reduce America ’ s greenhouse gas emissions . it should transform its immigration policy to recruit the best and brightest people from around the world to move to the US and become citizens , and remain the world ’ s leading champion of open markets , especially during the current financial crisis .
closing the prison at Guantánamo and reaffirming America ’ s commitment to international law and human rights will also be an important step in this direction .
the world wants to believe in an America that lives up to its own best values .
the prospect of a truly global community of nations working together to achieve the greater good for all is indeed exciting .
but , although America has been far from perfect over the last six decades , the end of thepax Americanahas the potential to create a dangerous void in international affairs .
if the world is going to shift in the direction of a new and more globally democratic system , other nations will need to meaningfully step forward to assume new responsibilities .
it is in America ’ s and the world ’ s interest that they do so . the evidence of this will be seen not only in global institutions but also in places like Darfur , Zimbabwe , and Burma .
until this happens , let us all hope that America can get back on track as the global champion of collaborative action to address the world ’ s greatest challenges and work with as many other countries as possible to move collectively in the right direction .
a decade ago , people spoke of the end of history , meaning the ultimate triumph of a liberal capitalist political order .
nowadays , many scoff at that notion as too simplistic .
nonetheless , we are at both the end and beginning of something remarkable .
in the wake of the death of the utopian - and often bloody - certainties of the 19th and 20th centuries ( Communism &apos;s collapse was but the latest spectacular example ) , and with fading belief in the liberal welfare state , traditional views about work , retirement , education , the Church , solidarity , and other social institutions are changing rapidly .
the central driver of all this is today &apos;s enormous acceleration in the underlying pace of technological and economic change .
call itfast-forward modernization .
of course , the worldwide crash of high-tech stocks in 2000 chilled the hype about a &quot; new economy &quot; that seemed to be emerging at the &quot; end of history . &quot;
but falling share prices should not blind us to the fact that on top of the ongoing information revolution , three fresh waves of revolutionary technology are poised to hit : bio-technology ( including new medical technologies and genetic engineering , such as the creation of human embryos through cloning ) , nanotechnology , and robotics .
each is its own industrial revolution , and will profoundly alter our lives and ways of thinking .
indeed , the revolution is already upon us .
for the first time in history , a global techno-market order is transforming the world of finance , business , politics and , indeed , physiology , beyond recognition .
this new techno-market system is shaped and characterized by a belief in the increasing importance of knowledge , new ideas , innovations and new technologies , and a higher pace of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called &quot; creative destruction . &quot;
as a result , corporate capitalism is rapidly becoming obsolete , replaced by a creative capitalism in which entrepreneurship , combined with a greater willingness to adopt innovations , transforms the business landscape .
innovative start-up firms become huge companies faster than ever before .
but these infant giants are quickly threatened with eclipse by even newer enterprises .
take the example of computers .
it took 15 years for other countries to compete successfully with America &apos;s Silicon Valley in semi-conductors , but less than five years in Internet technology .
this system provides unprecedented financial incentives to scientists and entrepreneurs to aggressively develop new technologies and thus become rich .
but the revolution is not only for the elite ; it also offers a realistic ( non-utopian ) promise of dramatically improved lives for many people around the entire globe - not in 100 years , but in the foreseeable future .
we are notjust witnessing a simple adaptation of social structures and ways of living to suit new technologies .
the Nobel laureate Robert Fogel argues that a new synergism between technological and physiological improvements has produced a radically new form of human evolution , which he callstechnophysio evolution .
only this , Fogel believes , can explain recent trends in longevity , body size , the durability of vital organs , and chronic diseases .
these changes are also triggering changes in human consciousness .
the result is a litany of &quot; post-utopian &quot; values that include a stronger emphasis on individual freedom and personal responsibility .
in this world without utopia , individual freedom is the supreme value .
but , as with any change of such magnitude , there are holdouts .
indeed , politics everywhere now seems dominated by the &quot; war of lifestyles &quot; that has emerged from today &apos;s emphasis on individual autonomy .
not so long ago , issues such as the environment , the balance of work versus leisure in daily life , and the role of marriage , abortion , and other family concerns were secondary political disputes , as politicians fought over who would receive what share of a nation &apos;s wealth .
now these issues define domestic political agendas .
much of the new battle over lifestyles is undoubtedly misunderstood , perhaps because debates about them are conducted in a simplistic way : anti-global movements versus multi-nationals , environmentalists versus corporate polluters , small farmers versus agro-business , and so on .
but , beyond slogans , there is an underlying fault line between those who have the cultural capacity to embrace change and those who resist it by adhering to traditional ideas about how one &apos;s life and , by extension , society , should be organized .
this conflict exists globally .
in societies that have been preparing themselves by opening their markets and embracing universal education , the disruptions of this revolution can probably be absorbed and handled .
conflict is most acute in closed societies characterized by a politically repressive climate and culturally induced obstacles to growth .
such obstacles include the absence of an informed and capable workforce , instinctive mistrust and rejection of new ideas and technologies just because they come from the West , lack of respect for those who acquire new knowledge , and endemic discrimination against women .
the new battle of lifestyles has given rise to new enemies of open societies , such as the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
it is no coincidence that terrorism thrives in societies that are intrinsically hostile to today &apos;s modernizing values and belief in individual autonomy .
so long as these ideas clash , violence will lurk .
to defend post-utopian values in the longer-term , politicians ( and generals and spymasters ) cannot seek security by drastically curtailing fundamental freedoms , because to do so risks forfeiting public support and a weakening of the pillars of the post-utopian market order .
in challenging groups like Al Qaeda , they must understand that they are engaged in a war of ideas ; winning the hearts - and the lifestyles - of societies is the only way to win that battle .
London – Even after the passage of new financial regulations in the United States , the Dodd-Frank Act , and the publication of the Basel Committee ’ s new capital requirements , the financial sector ’ s prospects over the next few years remain highly uncertain .
there has been some recovery in prices for bank shares from the lows of 2008 , of course , but that rally faltered recently .
quite apart from their concerns about the robustness of the rebound in the economy , investors are uncertain about many financial firms ’ business models , and about the future size , shape , and profitability of the financial sector in general .
after all , banks remain deeply unpopular in all developed countries .
bankers are still social pariahs , as lowly valued by the public as drug dealers or journalists .
they are reviled if they lose money , and assailed if they make it .
for banks and their shareholders , it looks a case of heads they win , tails we lose .
thus , as banks return to profitability , politicians in North America and Europe have begun to talk again about new taxes that would skim those profits off to the benefit of taxpayers , whose support kept banks in business at the height of the crisis .
this is a huge contrast with the financial sector ’ s position in the previous three decades .
from the late 1970 ’ s until 2007 , the financial sector grew far more rapidly than the real economy .
in 1980 , financial assets – stocks , bonds , and bank deposits – totaled around 100 % of GDP in the advanced economies .
by 2007 , the figure was over 400 % in the US , the United Kingdom , and Japan .
during this period , credit expanded rapidly as a share of GDP , reaching more than 300 % at the peak .
in the UK , the profits of financial intermediaries , which had averaged around 1.5 % of the whole economy ’ s profits in the 1970 ’ s , reached 15 % in 2008 .
in the US , bank profits were an even larger share of the total .
this was the golden age of finance .
bankers ’ pay soared alongside profits – indeed , it grew even faster .
to paraphrase William Wordsworth , bliss was it in that dawn to be alive , and to be a derivatives trader was very heaven .
but the expansion came to a shuddering halt in 2008 , the first year in decades in which aggregate financial assets fell , and there is still little sign of a sustained recovery .
is this a short-term phenomenon ?
will the financial sector return to pre-crisis growth rates when the economic situation has been fully stabilized ?
will financial “ deepening ” continue ?
will bank stocks once again outperform the market ?
a recent study by Andy Haldane and others at the Bank of England casts doubt on the prospect of a return to the status quo ante .
they note that the Golden Age was in fact an unusual period , if you look at the last two centuries of economic history .
Haldane bases his analysis on the trend in the Gross Value Added ( GVA ) of the financial sector .
over the last 160 years , the GVA of finance has grown by two percentage points a year faster than that of the economy as a whole .
but this excess growth has not been evenly spread .
during the two decades leading up to World War I , the financial sector grew almost four times faster than the economy , in the first wave of financial deepening and globalization , but from 1918 until the 1970 ’ s , finance expanded less rapidly than average economic growth .
only when markets were deregulated and liberalized from the early 1970 ’ s onwards did finance once again leap ahead .
in the US , financial sector GVA was only 2 % of the total in the 1950s , but stands at 8 % today .
Haldane believes that this growth spurt is well and truly over .
he argues that much of the apparent growth in value added has in fact been illusory , based on increased leverage , excess trading , and banks writing deep out-of-the-money options – for example , credit-default swaps ( a $ 60 trillion market in 2007 ) . “ What all these strategies had in common , ” writes Haldane , “ was that they involved banks assuming risk in the hunt for yield – risk that was often disguised because it was parked in the tail of the return distribution . ”
from a regulator ’ s perspective , this is a powerful argument for requiring higher capital to constrain the risk that banks can take on .
indeed , the Basel Committee plans to require more capital in the future , though the new requirements will be delayed , owing to concerns about the cost and availability of credit to sustain the recovery .
against that background , it is hard to believe that we will quickly return to the heady growth in financial assets , credit , and risk we saw from the 1970 ’ s to 2007 .
financial-sector returns are likely to be lower .
returns of 20 % on equity targets are a thing of the past .
and lower profitability will reduce pay more effectively than any direct regulatory controls .
for most of us , unless we remain seriously overweight in financial stocks , this may not be a bad prospect .
we do not want to inflate another asset-price bubble on the scale of the one that burst in 2007-2008 .
but there is a risk for regulators and central banks .
if they over-constrain the financial sector , risk may migrate outside the regulatory frontier , where it will be harder to measure and monitor .
that is why it is important to maintain some flexibility , to allow currently unregulated institutions like hedge funds and private-equity funds to be swept into the regulatory net if they become large and systemically important .
the tighter their controls on risk in banks , the more frontier police the regulators will need .
the Middle East is a place where the dust hardly ever settles .
when it occasionally does , even for a short interval – as UN Resolution 1701 for cessation of hostilities in Lebanon seems to be holding – it is time to take stock of events in the hopes that a responsible debate may influence those in power .
let ’ s start with the United States .
President George W. Bush has been short on neither initiatives nor catchy slogans and acronyms .
recent years are littered with them : “ Global War on Terror ” ( GWOT ) , “ Road Map , ” “ Middle East Partnership Initiative “ ( MEPI ) , “ Broader Middle East and North Africa ” ( BMENA ) – originally “ Greater Middle East Initiative ( GMEI ) – Democracy Assisted Dialogue ( DAD ) , and so on .
his latest reverie , envisioned in the thick of the recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah , was the New Middle East ( NME ) , with US clients Israel , Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia serving as the pillars of regional order .
but like all his previous initiatives since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington almost five years ago now , the NME ran into trouble from the outset .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced its birth while rejecting an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon .
her poor timing made the initiative appear heartless , as thousands of civilians were being uprooted , killed , or maimed by Israel ’ s efficient but ruthless artillery and air force .
this so embarrassed the three Arab NME partners that each raced to distance itself from the US-sponsored initiative .
Saudi Arabia , which had remained silent for nearly two weeks , did so with a $ 500 million contribution to rebuilding devastated areas of Lebanon and another billion to support Lebanon ’ s threatened currency .
Egypt ’ s heir apparent Gamal Mubarak followed suit in the fourth week of the fighting by heading a 70-member delegation on a solidarity visit to Beirut .
but , rather than earning him the respect of an outraged Egyptian public , revelations in the opposition press that his plane had to obtain a safe passage and authority to land from the Israelis garnered only howls of derision .
as for America , anything it touches in the Middle East has become radioactive , even for longstanding clients and friends .
in the course of maneuvering to delay the UN ceasefire , Bush and Rice continually reiterated the need for a Security Council resolution that deals forcefully with “ the roots of the problem . ”
of course , for them and for Israel , this was Hezbollah and the need to eradicate or at a minimum disarm it and force its fighters to a safe distance from settlements and towns in northern Israel .
while this is a reasonable demand , the rest of the Middle East – and , indeed , much of the world , including Europe – regard the root cause of the conflict as Israeli intransigence and arrogance , together with America ’ s blind support for it .
both America and Israel have cited foot-dragging in implementing UN Resolution 1559 , which calls for disarming all non-state actors in Lebanon and the deployment of government forces all the way to the southern border .
but for years the US and Israel have not uttered a word about the dozens of UN resolutions , going back as far as Resolution 49 on partition in 1947 , which called for the establishment of distinct Arab and Jewish states on roughly half of Mandated Palestine .
this and numerous other resolutions seeking redress for injustices toward Palestinians have been ignored by the US .
thus , for 300 million Arabs and more than one billion Muslims the “ root cause ” of the Middle East conflict is not Hezbollah .
as its leader , Hassan Nasrallah aptly put it , “ We are just a reaction to chronic injustice . ”
it may well be that there is more than one root cause – every party to the conflict has a favorite one .
there is no point in belaboring whose pain is greater or whose root cause is deeper .
in fact , arguing over grievances merely drives the sides further apart .
the long overdue UN Resolution 1701 may , with its adoption , indicate that all parties are fatigued , or could no longer withstand international pressure .
this is good news for all concerned and provides an opportunity to tackle each party ’ s “ root cause . ”
seizing the opportunity requires that humility rather than moral supremacy prevails .
empathy , not ethnocentrism , should be the order of the day now that the guns are falling silent and we have rediscovered the limits of military force .
but if we have learned anything at all from the tragic assassinations of the region ’ s greatest peacemakers , Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin , it is that the guns do not remain silent for long .
during any lull , a fanatic from either side could jump to center stage and , through an act of utter madness , kick up the settling dust and dash the hopes of the many on both sides who still long for a lasting peace .
``Failed state &apos; &apos; is a term applied frequently to Afghanistan and is often deemed the cause for why terrorists gained such influence there .
but a country does not fail of its own volition , nor is it weakened by unknown causes .
a country fails , when it fails , for definite , identifiable reasons .
these must be addressed if Afghanistan is to be revived .
Twenty years of invasion , civil war , and drought have left Afghanistan &apos;s institutions in ruin .
millions of Afghans huddle in refugee camps or are displaced from their homes .
Land-mines defile the countryside .
millions are sick and poor ; many live at starvation levels .
for these and many other reasons , rebuilding Afghanistan &apos;s economy will require not only economic reconstruction but an effort to reinvent the country &apos;s political and cultural institutions .
such a massive effort will be doomed to failure , however , if Afghanistan &apos;s neighbors intervene in ways that promote economic upheaval all over again .
Afghanistan is no place for quick fixes .
rebuilding the country cannot be done cheaply .
any thought that the anti-terror coalition will be able to bail out fast ( as the West did when it abandoned Afghanistan to its fate after the Soviet withdrawal ten years ago ) should be forgotten .
the West must stick with Afghanistan until its reconstruction is established .
otherwise , it runs the risk of renewed chaos and violence , but this time in a more destabilized region , as Pakistan &apos;s current problems demonstrate .
three problems are of immediate concern , the most important being feeding the Afghan people - both within the country and in refugee camps outside Afghanistan .
humanitarian aid is being delivered , but a distribution system safe from the predations of Afghanistan &apos;s warlords needs to be built .
indeed , the warlords have been given too big a say in distributing aid already , and it may be hard to strip them of this power .
but stripped they must be .
the second problem involves relocating Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan and Iran , as well as those displaced within Afghanistan .
to achieve this goal , the agricultural economy must be revived in order to revive this industry , providing jobs and food for people .
a massive impediment here is the millions of mines left over from the Soviet invasion that must be removed .
the West has a big incentive to be generous to Afghanistan &apos;s rural poor .
Starving farmers , if unassisted , may return to cultivating a very reliable cash crop : the opium poppy , long a staple of the warlord economy .
eliminating it will not only help farmers and the West as it tries to curtail heroin use , but also Afghanistan &apos;s infant government as it struggles to assert its national authority against the warlords .
a bankrupt warlord , after all , cannot buy weapons or bribe people to maintain their loyalty .
major infrastructure investments will also be needed if the economy is to be revived .
housing , particularly for returning refugees , will need to be constructed fast .
cities such as Kabul , Mazar , Herat and others will need to be rebuilt as centers of economic and cultural life .
village housing must be provided at a massive level .
roads , airports and communications systems must also be revitalized if trade is to be restored .
the educational system needs to be rebuilt almost from scratch , and with so many women anxious to return to teaching , a revived educational system will also help Afghanistan &apos;s democratic politicians gain a powerful lobby of workers .
particular attention should be given to elementary schools and libraries outside of cities .
Afghanistan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction , as it is not a society with a strong political center .
Planners should take advantage of the country &apos;s decentralized nature and emphasize private sector participation in reconstruction .
a decentralized system will respond better to local needs and avoid an over-bureaucratic public sector .
but autonomous economic regions should be avoided as a threat to Afghan national unity because they would play into the hands of the warlords .
Moreover , poorer regions would do badly in such a system .
in the long run , Afghanistan has resources that can be exploited .
there is the potential for oil and gas exploration , and of mining iron ore and precious metals .
these activities should be explored in a framework of economic development across Central Asia .
Afghanistan , indeed , must be integrated into the regional pipeline and other development schemes .
Afghans can contribute in a tangible way here by reopening the North-South route connecting the resource rich economies of Central Asia to densely populated India and Pakistan .
none of this will be possible unless Afghanistan &apos;s young males are disarmed and given productive work .
essential here , is to attract expatriate Afghans with skills and professional achievements to help in rebuilding the country by establishing small firms that will suck up the unemployed .
expatriate involvement will also likely support the rights of women to participate fully and legally in economic and political life , as was the case before 1978 .
finally , donor countries must apply the lessons learned in restoring the war-ravaged states of the former Yugoslavia .
grants and planning must be coordinated , and the consent of Afghanistan &apos;s neighboring countries assured .
if the latter are ignored , regional interests can incite chaos once again .
an international conference on Afghanistan should be called by the US and held under UN auspices .
it must affirm not only Afghanistan &apos;s territorial integrity , but insure that donor commitments meet the scale of the job and that these promises are kept .
a decade ago , the West turned its back on Afghanistan and chaos ensued .
to abandon the country again would be criminal folly .
new HAVEN – The devastation – both human and physical – from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan is unfathomable .
it is impossible at this point to gauge the full extent of the damage with any degree of precision .
but we can nonetheless begin to assess its potential spillover effects on the rest of Asia and other major economies around the world .
the narrow view of the catastrophe ’ s economic impact is that Japan doesn ’ t really matter anymore .
after all , more than 20 years of unusually sluggish trend growth in Japanese output has sharply reduced its incremental impact on the broader global economy .
the disaster may produce some disproportionate supply-chain effects in autos and information-technology product lines such as flash drives , but any such disruptions would tend to be transitory .
on the surface , the world ’ s two largest economies have little to fear .
Japan accounts for only 5 % of America ’ s exports and 8 % of China ’ s .
under the worst-case outcome of a complete disruption to the Japanese economy , the direct repercussions on the United States and Chinese economies would be small – shaving no more than a few tenths of a percentage point off their annual growth rates .
within the so-called G-10 developed economies , Australia has the largest direct exposure to Japan – the destination of about 19 % of its total exports .
the eurozone is at the opposite end of the spectrum , with Japan accounting for less than 2 % of its exports .
among emerging-markets , the Philippines and Indonesia are the most exposed to Japan , which absorbs about 16 % of their total exports .
South Korea , the third-largest economy in East Asia , is at the other end of the scale , relying on Japanese demand for only about 6 % of its exports .
but the narrow view misses the most critical consideration : this “ Japan shock ” has not occurred at a time of great economic strength .
that is true not only of Japan itself , where two lost decades have left a once-vigorous economy on a less-than-1 % growth trajectory since the early 1990 ’ s .
but it is also true of the broader global economy , which was only just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis and recession since the 1930 ’ s .
Moreover , the Japan shock is not the only negative factor at work today .
the impacts of sharply rising oil prices and ongoing sovereign debt problems in Europe are also very worrisome .
while each of these shocks may not qualify as the proverbial tipping point , the combination and the context are disconcerting , to say the least .
context is vital .
notwithstanding the euphoric resurgence of global equity markets over the past two years , the world economy remains fragile .
what markets seem to have forgotten is that post-bubble , post-financial-crisis recoveries tend to be anemic .
economies grow at something much closer to their stall speeds , thus lacking the cyclical “ escape velocity ” required for a self-sustaining recovery .
as a result , post-crisis economies are far more vulnerable to shocks and prone to relapses than might otherwise be the case .
Alas , there is an added complication that makes today ’ s shocks all the more vexing : governments and central banks have exhausted the traditional ammunition upon which they have long relied during times of economic duress .
that is true of both monetary and fiscal policy – the two mainstays of modern countercyclical stabilization .
policy interest rates are close to zero in the major economies in the developed world , and outsize budget deficits are the norm .
as a result , unconventional – and untested – policies , such as so-called “ quantitative easing , ” have become the rage among central bankers .
all along , such unconventional policies were viewed as a temporary fix .
the hope was that policy settings soon would return to pre-crisis norms .
but , with one shock following another , the “ exit strategy ” keeps being deferred .
just as it is next to impossible to take a critically ill patient off life-support treatment , it is equally difficult to wean post-bubble economies from their now steady dose of liquidity injections and deficit spending .
in an era of extraordinarily high unemployment , political pressures only compound the problem .
this raises perhaps the most troublesome concern of all : with a post-crisis world getting hit by one shock after another , and with central banks having no latitude to cut interest rates , it is not hard to envision a scenario of open-ended monetary expansion that ends in tears .
the dreaded inflationary endgame suddenly looms as a very real possibility .
none of this detracts from the resilience factor .
yes , Japan will rebuild , which will undoubtedly spur some type of recovery in its disaster-battered economy .
that happened in the aftermath of the Hanshin ( Kobe ) earthquake in 1995 , and it will happen this time as well .
but , just as the post-Kobe rebuilding did little to end the first of Japan ’ s lost decades , a similar outcome can be expected this time .
the upside of rebuilding – beyond the urgent restoration of normal life for thousands of people – is only a temporary palliative for an impaired economy .
that ’ s only one of the lessons that Japan offers the rest of us .
the Japanese economy has , in fact , been on the leading edge of many of the more serious problems that have afflicted the global economy in recent years .
from asset bubbles and a dysfunctional financial system to currency suppression and monetary-policy blunders , Japan has been in many respects the laboratory of our future .
unfortunately , the world has failed to learn the lessons of Japan . and now it risks missing another important clue .
the significance of the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 is not the relatively low magnitude of Japan ’ s direct impact on the broader global economy .
the more meaningful message is how these shocks box the rest of us into an even tighter corner .
new YORK – It is said that Americans have a genius for simplification .
gradually , however , the quest for it has become a global trend , one that continues to conquer new territories , just as blue jeans once did .
the speed of our daily life is visibly increased – and not for the better – by this unstoppable evolution .
the tyranny of pragmatism seems to mark all of the complex dilemmas of our time .
too many valid choices are ignored or skirted through the routine of short-cuts .
nowhere is this trend more damaging than in today ’ s mercantile approach to art .
even the much-praised notion of competition seems fake and cynically manipulated by the “ corporate ” mentality that now pervades the world of culture – by the financial pre-selection that determines what publishers , producers , and other impresarios will support .
just imagine what might have happened with the works of , say , Proust , Kafka , Musil , Faulkner , or Borges had they been subjected to mass-market competition like shoes or cosmetics .
culture is a necessary pause from the daily rat race , from our chaotic and often vulgar political surroundings , and it is a chance to recover our spiritual energy .
great books , music , and paintings are not only an extraordinary school of beauty , truth , and good , but also a way of discovering our own beauty , truth , and good – the potential for change , of bettering ourselves and even some of our interlocutors .
if this respite and refuge is gradually narrowed and invaded by the same kind of “ products ” as those that dominate the mass market , we are condemned to be perpetual captives of the same stunted universe of “ practicalities , ” the ordinary agglomeration of clichés packaged in advertisements .
I was thinking again about these old and seemingly unsolvable questions during my re-reading of a quite challenging novel by a close friend and a great writer , not very present in the vivid landscape of American letters of today .
the theme , style , and echo of his work says a lot , I think , about our simplified world .
the novel is Blinding , by Claudio Magris .
hailed in Europe as one of the great novels of the twentieth century , Blinding arrived in America only after a great delay , and never received the attention that it deserved .
unfortunately , that is no surprise .
the number of literary translations done nowadays in the United States is , according to a United Nations report , equal to that of Greece , a country one-tenth the size .
imported books are thought to be too “ complicated , ” which is another way of saying that literature should deal with simple issues in a simple way , obeying the rules of the mass market , with its tricks of packaging , accessibility , advertisement , and comfort .
at the core of Magris ’ book is the destiny of a group of Italian communists who travel to Yugoslavia after the Second World War to contribute to the construction of a socialist society , only to be caught in the conflict between Stalin and Tito .
they are imprisoned for their Stalinist allegiance ; when they are finally allowed to return to Italy , their old comrades refuse to accept them .
the book ’ s plot spans two centuries of revolution .
then , suddenly ,
“ the party vanished , overnight , as if all of a sudden a giant sponge had drained the entire sea , Adriatic and Austral , leaving litter and clots of mud , and all the boats stranded .
how can you go home again if the sea has been sucked down a vast drain that opened up beneath it , emptying it who knows where , into a void ?
the earth is arid and dead , but there won ’ t be another one , nor another heaven . ”
the solitude of the individual facing his faith alone , without collective illusions , and forced to do something with himself in the arid , noisy world tells us something important about the exiled world of modernity and its complex and contradictory problems .
Magris ’ s novel is not only an important literary achievement ; it also has a deep connection to the dangers that we face now , particularly the wave of fanaticism , from Mumbai to Oslo , in the name of a holy war against the “ other . ”
are all the extremists searching for a new coherence , for a lost illusion of togetherness and a new hope of resurrection ?
can we ever forget September 11 , 2001 , the start of a bloody century in which the mystical force of hatred and destruction has recovered its strength ?
are Osama Bin Laden ’ s minions , the bloody Hamas-Hezbollah battalions , or troubled loners like Timothy McVeigh , Theodore Kaczynski , and now Norway ’ s Anders Behring Breivik , the “ heroes ” of our contemporary nightmare ?
is this the “ rebel ” response to an overly globalized , incoherent , and ultimately disturbing reality ?
if so , their barbarism demands scrutiny – in relation to both historical precedent and to our modernity – rather than merely being labeled “ monstrous ” ( though it certainly is that ) .
the new religious militants , fighting in the name of their particular and peculiar God , seem as fanaticized as the Fascists , Nazis , and Communists of earlier decades .
Magris ’ s main character is a rebel in more than one embodiment : as Salvatore Cipico , one of the inmates in the communist concentration camp in Yugoslavia ; as Jurgen Jurgensen , ephemeral king of Iceland and a convict forced to build his own jail ; and as Jason , the mythic adventurer searching for the volatile truth .
a multilayered and complex chronicle of the devastating tragedies of the twentieth century , Blinding is an insistent , informed , and irreplaceable incursion into the moving landscape of the human soul , its wounds and voids , its vitality and versatility , its deep distortions and its unpredictable dynamics .
it is a fascinating story about the conflict between ideals and reality , or Utopia and humanness ; about being faithful to a cause and betraying it ; and about sacrifice and solidarity .
it is also a rich and original literary achievement that challenges today ’ s consumerist ethic .
by renouncing simplicity , it also repudiates today ’ s prevailing confusion of information with literature , of facts with creativity , and best-selling products with true works of art .
the release of Alan Greenspan ’ s ghostwritten memoirs The Age of Turbulence has elicited charges that he was not such a great central banker after all .
Stan Collender of National Journal sees the fingerprints of the White House on these attacks : Greenspan is harshly critical of George W. Bush ’ s administration , after all , and to attack the credibility of Republican ex-policymakers who are critical of Bush is standard counterpunching for it .
but what is one to make of the criticisms of Greenspan ’ s tenure at the Federal Reserve ?
the indictment contains four counts : that Greenspan wrongly cheered the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages , which fueled the housing bubble ; that he wrongly endorsed Bush ’ s tax cuts ; that he should have reined in the stock market bubble of the 1990 ’ s ; and that he should have done the same with the real estate bubble of the 2000 ’ s .
to the first two counts , Greenspan now pleads guilty .
he says that he did not understand how the growth of non-standard mortgages had lured borrowers and investors into bearing dangerous risks .
he was , he now says , focusing on how fixed-rate mortgages are relatively bad deals for borrowers in times of low inflation , which was a mistake .
Greenspan also pleads guilty to a mistake in early 2001 .
he thought that he was giving balanced testimony to Congress on government budget issues .
he testified that it is important to run surpluses to pay down the debt , but that surpluses must not be so large that the government winds up owning American industry .
he also testified that tax cuts are better than spending increases to keep surpluses from growing too large , but that uncertainty is enormous , so that any tax cuts should be canceled if they threatened to bring us back to an age of deficits .
Robert Rubin and Kent Conrad warned him that the press would not interpret his testimony as being balanced , and that Congress would interpret it as an excuse to abandon fiscal discipline .
they were right .
Greenspan also pleads guilty to misunderstanding the character of the Bush administration .
he thought that his old reality-based friends from the Ford administration were back in power .
he thought that he – and Treasury Secretary Paul O ’ Neill – could win the quiet “ inside game ” for sensible policy without resorting to an “ outside game ” that would make his reappointment in 2004 unlikely .
he was wrong .
but how serious are these policy-political crimes to which Greenspan now pleads guilty ?
in my view , they are misdemeanors .
against them you have to set what former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers calls Greenspan ’ s “ golden glove ” performance at avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years at the Fed .
the “ felonies ” of which Greenspan stands accused are the other two charges : that he should have done more to stop the stock market bubble of the late 1990 ’ s , and that he should have done more to stop the housing bubble of the early 2000 ’ s .
here , Greenspan holds his ground , and pleads not guilty .
the only way , he says , for the Fed to have kept stock prices in reasonable equilibrium ranges in the late 1990 ’ s would have been to raise interest rates so high that they hit the real economy on the head with a brick .
interest rates high enough to curb stock market speculation would also have curbed construction and other forms of investment , raised unemployment , and sent the economy into recession .
to cause a significant current evil in order to avoid a possible future danger when our knowledge is limited and our judgments uncertain is , Greenspan believes , unwise .
in this , he is following a tradition of caution that extends from Edmund Burke to John Maynard Keynes .
Greenspan mounts a similar defense concerning the housing bubble .
high construction employment has been good for American workers in the past half-decade – a period that has not produced much good for them .
higher interest rates to reduce the housing boom seem , even in retrospect , ill advised if the cost is mass unemployment .
and Greenspan eschews paternalism : he would not assume the role of a regulator telling people that they cannot buy a house even though a lender is willing to finance it .
but Greenspan would have served the country and the world better if he had been somewhat more paternalist in slowing the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages .
he would have served the country and the world better had he been less of a loyal Republican working the inside game of trying to convince Bush ’ s political advisors that good policy was important , and more of a nonpartisan steward of America ’ s long-term fiscal stability .
of course , such a Greenspan would never have been re-appointed .
all in all , Greenspan served the United States and the world well through his stewardship of monetary policy , especially by what he did not do : trying to stop stock and housing speculation by halting the economy in its tracks .
Cambridge – When the next full-scale global financial crisis hits , let it not be said that the International Monetary Fund never took a stab at forestalling it .
recently , the IMF proposed a new global tax on financial institutions loosely in proportion to their size , as well as a tax on banks ’ profits and bonuses .
the Fund ’ s proposal has been greeted with predictable disdain and derision by the financial industry .
more interesting and significant are the mixed reviews from G-20 presidents and finance ministers .
governments at the epicenter of the recent financial crisis , especially the United States and the United Kingdom , are downright enthusiastic , particularly about the tax on size .
after all , they want to do that anyway .
countries that did not experience recent bank meltdowns , such as Canada , Australia , China , Brazil , and India , are unenthusiastic .
why should they change systems that proved so resilient ?
it is all too easy to criticize the specifics of the IMF plan .
but the IMF ’ s big-picture diagnosis of the problem gets a lot right .
financial systems are bloated by implicit taxpayer guarantees , which allow banks , particularly large ones , to borrow money at interest rates that do not fully reflect the risks they take in search of outsized profits .
since that risk is then passed on to taxpayers , imposing taxes on financial firms in proportion to their borrowing is a simple way to ensure fairness .
“ What risks ? ” the financial firms demand to know .
the average cost of the bailouts was “ only ” a few percentage points of GNP .
and the crisis was a once-in-a-half-century event .
the IMF rightly points out that these claims are nonsense .
during the crisis , taxpayers were on the hook for almost a quarter of national income .
perhaps the next crisis will not turn out so “ well , ” and the losses borne by the public will be staggering .
even with the “ success ” of the bailouts , countries suffered massive output losses due to recessions and sustained subpar growth .
but , while regulation must address the oversized bank balance sheets that were at the root of the crisis , the IMF is right not to focus excessively on fixing the “ too big to fail ” problem .
a surprising number of pundits seem to think that if one could only break up the big banks , governments would be far more resilient to bailouts , and the whole “ moral hazard ” problem would be muted .
that logic is dubious , given how many similar crises have hit widely differing systems over the centuries .
a systemic crisis that simultaneously hits a large number of medium-sized banks would put just as much pressure on governments to bail out the system as would a crisis that hits a couple of large banks .
there are altogether too many complex ideas floating around that look good on paper , but might well prove deeply flawed in a big-time crisis .
any robust solution must be reasonably simple to understand and implement .
the IMF proposal seems to pass these tests .
by contrast , some finance specialists favor forcing banks to rely much more on “ contingent ” debt that can be forcibly converted to ( possibly worthless ) stock in the event of a system-wide meltdown .
but how this form of “ pre-packaged bankruptcy ” could be implemented in a world of widely different legal , political , and banking systems is unclear .
financial history is littered with untested safety-net devices that failed in a crisis .
better to rein in the growth of the system .
the IMF is on much weaker ground , however , in thinking that its one-size-fits-all global tax system will somehow level the playing field internationally .
it won ’ t .
countries that now have solid financial regulatory systems in place are already effectively “ taxing ” their financial firms more than , say , the US and the UK , where financial regulation is more minimal .
the US and the UK don ’ t want to weaken their competitive advantage by taxing banks while some other countries do not .
but it is their systems that are in the greatest and most urgent need of stronger checks and balances .
let ’ s not go too far in defending the “ holdout ” countries that are resisting the IMF proposal .
these countries need to recognize that if the US and the UK do implement even modest reforms , a lot of capital will flow elsewhere , potentially overwhelming regulatory systems that seemed to work well until now .
and what about the second tax proposed by the IMF , on banks ’ profits and bonuses ?
such a tax is politically appealing , but ultimately it makes little sense – except , perhaps , in a crisis year when bank subsidies are glaringly transparent .
it would be better to improve financial-market regulation directly and let national tax systems handle banks ’ income like that of any other industry .
the IMF ’ s first effort at prescribing a cure may be flawed , but its diagnosis of a financial sector bloated by moral hazard is manifestly correct .
let ’ s hope that when the G-20 leaders meet later this year , they decide to take the problem seriously instead of tabling discussion for a decade or two until the next crisis is upon us .
Beijing – Now that the “ green shoots ” of recovery have withered , the debate over fiscal stimulus is back with a vengeance .
in the United States , those who argue for another stimulus package observe that it was always wishful thinking to believe that a $ 787 billion package could offset a $ 3 trillion fall in private spending .
but unemployment has risen even faster and further than expected .
combine this with the continued fall in housing prices , and it is understandable that consumer spending remains depressed .
the banks , having been recapitalized only to the extent necessary to keep them afloat , still have weak balance sheets .
their consequent reluctance to lend constrains investment .
meanwhile , state governments , seeing revenues fall as a result of lower taxable incomes last year , are cutting back like mad .
if there was a case for additional stimulus back in February , that case is even stronger now .
but the case against additional stimulus is also strong .
the US federal deficit is an alarming 12 % of GDP , and public debt as a share of national income is already projected to double , to 80 % of GDP .
the idea that the US can grow out of its debt burden , as did Finland and Sweden following their financial crises in the 1990 ’ s , seems unrealistic .
given all this , more deficit spending will only stoke fears of higher future taxes and inflation .
it will encourage the reemergence of global imbalances .
and it will not reassure consumers or investors .
it is possible to argue the economics both ways , but the politics all point in one direction .
the US Congress lacks the stomach for another stimulus package .
it has already faced intense criticism for its failure to get the country ’ s fiscal house in order .
the slowness with which the first stimulus has been rolled out , and the fact that it will take even more time for its full effects to be felt , provides more fodder for the chattering classes .
disappointment over the effects of the TARP has already destroyed popular – and Congressional – support for more public money to recapitalize the banks .
so , even those who find the economic logic of arguments for fiscal activism compelling must acknowledge that the politics are not supportive .
a second stimulus simply is not in the cards .
if there is going to be more aggregate demand , it can come from only one place .
that place is not Europe or Japan , where debts are even higher than in the US – and the demographic preconditions for servicing them less favorable .
rather , it is emerging markets like China .
the problem is that China has already done a lot to stimulate domestic demand , both through government spending and by directing its banks to lend .
as a result , its stock market is frothy , and it is experiencing an alarming property boom .
through May , property prices were up 18 % year on year .
understandably , Chinese officials worry about bubble trouble .
the obvious way to square this circle is to spend more on imports .
China can purchase more industrial machinery , transport equipment , and steelmaking material , which are among its leading imports from the US .
directing spending toward imports of capital equipment would avoid overheating China ’ s own markets , boost the economy ’ s productive capacity ( and thus its ability to grow in the future ) , and support demand for US , European , and Japanese products just when such support is needed most .
this strategy is not without risks .
allowing the renminbi to appreciate as a way of encouraging imports may also discourage exports , the traditional motor of Chinese growth .
and lowering administrative barriers to imports might redirect more spending toward foreign goods than the authorities intend .
but these are risks worth taking if China is serious about assuming a global leadership role .
the question is what China will get in return .
and the answer brings us back , full circle , to where we started , namely to US fiscal policy .
China is worried that its more than $ 1 trillion investment in US Treasury securities will not hold its value .
it wants reassurance that the US will stand behind its debts .
it therefore wants to see a credible program for balancing the US budget once the recession ends .
and , tough talk notwithstanding , the Obama administration has yet to offer a credible roadmap for fiscal consolidation .
doing so would reassure American taxpayers worried about current deficits .
just as importantly , it would reassure Chinese policymakers .
we live in a multipolar world where neither the US nor China is large enough to exercise global economic leadership on its own .
for China , leadership means assuming additional risks .
but for this to be tolerable , the US needs to relieve China of existing risks .
only by working together can the two countries lead the world economy out of its current doldrums .
new YORK – Does monarchy – constitutional monarchy , that is , not the despotic kind – have any redeeming features left ?
the arguments against maintaining kings and queens are mostly quite rational .
it is unreasonable in this democratic age to pay special deference to people solely on the basis of their birth .
are we really supposed to admire and love modern monarchies , such as the British House of Windsor , even more so today , just because some new princess has been plucked from the middle class ?
monarchy has an infantilizing effect .
witness how otherwise sensible adults are reduced to nervously grinning sycophants when they are granted the privilege of touching an extended royal hand .
at great monarchical displays , such as the royal wedding in London , millions become enthralled by child-like dreams of a “ fairy-tale ” marriage .
the mystique of immense wealth , noble birth , and great exclusivity is further sustained by the global mass media that promote these rituals .
now , one might argue that the dignified pomp of Queen Elizabeth II is preferable to the tawdry grandiosity of Silvio Berlusconi , Madonna , or Cristiano Ronaldo .
in fact , the British monarchy , especially , has been reinventing itself by adopting many of the most vulgar features of modern showbiz or sports celebrity .
and the worlds of royalty and popular fame often overlap .
for example , David Beckham and his ex-pop-star wife Victoria , live out their own dream of royalty , aping some of its gaudiest aspects .
they also happened to be among the favored guests at the latest royal wedding .
similarly , while Britain has many outstanding musicians , the favorite of the royal court is Elton John .
Infantile or not , there is a common human craving for taking vicarious pleasure in the lives of kings , queens , and other shining stars .
to call these people ’ s ostentatious displays of extravagance wasteful is to miss the point : a world of glittering dreams that must remain entirely beyond our grasp is precisely what many people want to see .
but there is another , darker side to this craving , which is the wish to see idols dragged through the mud in vicious gossip magazines , divorce courts , and so on .
this is the vengeful side of our fawning , as though the humiliation of worshipping idols must be balanced by our delight in their downfall .
indeed , to subject people who are born into royal families , or people who marry into them , to lives in a fishbowl , where they are on constant display , like actors and actresses in a continuous soap opera , where human relations are distorted and stunted by absurd rules of protocol , is a terrible form of cruelty .
the current Japanese empress and her daughter-in-law , both from non-aristocratic families , have had nervous breakdowns as a result .
likewise , movie stars often fall victim to alcohol , drugs , and breakdowns , but at least they have chosen the lives they live .
kings and queens , on the whole , have not .
Prince Charles might have been far happier as a gardener , but this was never an option .
one thing to be said for monarchs is that they provide people with a sense of continuity , which can be useful in times of crisis or radical change .
the King of Spain provided stability and continuity after the end of Franco ’ s dictatorship .
during World War II , European monarchs kept a sense of hope and unity alive among their subjects under Nazi occupation .
but there is something else , too .
monarchies are often popular with minorities .
Jews were among the most loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor .
Franz Joseph I stood up for his Jewish subjects when they were threatened by German anti-Semites .
to him , Jews , Germans , Czechs , or Hungarians were all his subjects , wherever they lived , from the smallest Galician shtetl to the grand capitals of Budapest or Vienna .
this offered some protection to minorities at a time of rising ethnic nationalism .
in this sense , monarchy is a little like Islam , or the Catholic Church : all believers are supposed to be equal in the eyes of God , or the Pope , or the Emperor – hence the appeal to the poor and the marginalized .
this might explain some right-wing populists ’ animus against monarchy .
the Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders , for example , has denounced Queen Beatrix on several occasions as a leftist , elitist , and multiculturalist .
like the new wave of populists worldwide , Wilders promises to take his country back for his followers , to stop immigration ( especially of Muslims ) , and to make the Netherlands Dutch again , whatever that means .
Beatrix , like Franz Joseph , refuses to make ethnic or religious distinctions between her subjects .
that is what she means when she preaches tolerance and mutual understanding .
to Wilders and his supporters , this is a sign of her molly-coddling of aliens , of appeasing Muslims .
to them , the queen seems almost anti-Dutch .
to be sure , like all European royal families , the origins of the Dutch royal family are decidedly mixed .
the emergence of kings and queens as specifically national figureheads is a relatively recent historical development .
Empires contained many nations , after all .
Queen Victoria , mostly of German blood , did not regard herself as a monarch of Britons alone , but of Indians , Malays , and many other peoples , too .
this aristocratic tradition of standing above the narrow strains of ethnic nationalism may be the best argument to hang on to royalty a little longer .
now that many European nations have become increasingly mixed in terms of ethnicity and culture , the only way forward is to learn to live together .
if monarchs can teach their subjects to do so , then let us give at least one cheer for the remaining kings and queens .
not surprisingly , the atmosphere at this year ’ s World Economic Forum was grim .
those who think that globalization , technology , and the market economy will solve the world ’ s problems seemed subdued .
most chastened of all were the bankers .
against the backdrop of the sub-prime crisis , the disasters at many financial institutions , and the weakening of the stock market , these “ masters of the universe ” seemed less omniscient than they did a short while ago .
and it was not just the bankers who were in the Davos doghouse this year , but also their regulators – the central bankers .
anyone who goes to international conferences is used to hearing Americans lecture everyone else about transparency .
there was still some of that at Davos .
I heard the usual suspects – including a former treasury secretary who had been particularly vociferous in such admonishments during the East Asia crisis – bang on about the need for transparency at sovereign wealth funds ( though not at American or European hedge funds ) .
but this time , developing countries could not resist commenting on the hypocrisy of it all . there was even a touch of schadenfreude in the air about the problems the United States is having right now – though it was moderated , of course , by worries about the downturn ’ s impact on their own economies .
had America really told others to bring in American banks to teach them about how to run their business ?
had America really boasted about its superior risk management systems , going so far as to develop a new regulatory system ( called Basle II ) ?
Basle II is dead – at least until memories of the current disaster fade .
bankers – and the rating agencies – believed in financial alchemy .
they thought that financial innovations could somehow turn bad mortgages into good securities , meriting AAA ratings .
but one lesson of modern finance theory is that , in well functioning financial markets , repackaging risks should not make much difference .
if we know the price of cream and the price of skim milk , we can figure out the price of milk with 1 % cream , 2 % cream , or 4 % cream .
there might be some money in repackaging , but not the billions that banks made by slicing and dicing sub-prime mortgages into packages whose value was much greater than their contents .
it seemed too good to be true – and it was .
worse , banks failed to understand the first principle of risk management : diversification only works when risks are not correlated , and macro-shocks ( such as those that affect housing prices or borrowers ’ ability to repay ) affect the probability of default for all mortgages .
I argued at Davos that central bankers also got it wrong by misjudging the threat of a downturn and failing to provide sufficient regulation .
they waited too long to take action .
because it normally takes a year or more for the full effects of monetary policy to be felt , central banks need to act preemptively , not reactively .
worse , the US Federal Reserve and its previous chairman , Alan Greenspan , may have helped create the problem , encouraging households to take on risky variable-rate mortgages by reassuring those who worried about a housing bubble that there was at most a little “ froth ” in the market .
normally , a Davos audience would rally to the support of the central bankers .
this time , a vote at the end of the session supported my view by a margin of three to one .
even the plea of one of central banker that “ no one could have predicted the problems ” moved few in the audience – perhaps because several people sitting there had , like me , explicitly warned about the impending problem in previous years .
the only thing we got wrong was how bad banks ’ lending practices were , how non-transparent banks really were , and how inadequate their risk management systems were .
it was interesting to see the different cultural attitudes to the crisis on display .
in Japan , the CEO of a major bank would have apologized to his employees and his country , and would have refused his pension and bonus so that those who suffered as a result of corporate failures could share the money .
he would have resigned .
in America , the only questions are whether a board will force a CEO to leave and , if so , how big his severance package will be .
when I asked one CEO whether there was any discussion of returning their bonuses , the response was not just no , but an aggressive defense of the bonus system .
this is the third US crisis in the past 20 years , after the Savings &amp; amp ; Loan crisis of 1989 and the Enron / WorldCom crisis in 2002 .
deregulation has not worked .
unfettered markets may produce big bonuses for CEO ’ s , but they do not lead , as if by an invisible hand , to societal well-being .
until we achieve a better balance between markets and government , the world will continue to pay a high price .
new YORK – In the aftermath of the Great Recession , countries have been left with unprecedented peacetime deficits and increasing anxieties about their growing national debts .
in many countries , this is leading to a new round of austerity – policies that will almost surely lead to weaker national and global economies and a marked slowdown in the pace of recovery .
those hoping for large deficit reductions will be sorely disappointed , as the economic slowdown will push down tax revenues and increase demands for unemployment insurance and other social benefits .
the attempt to restrain the growth of debt does serve to concentrate the mind – it forces countries to focus on priorities and assess values .
the United States is unlikely in the short term to embrace massive budget cuts , à la the United Kingdom .
but the long-term prognosis – made especially dire by health-care reform ’ s inability to make much of a dent in rising medical costs – is sufficiently bleak that there is increasing bipartisan momentum to do something .
President Barack Obama has appointed a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission , whose chairmen recently provided a glimpse of what their report might look like .
technically , reducing a deficit is a straightforward matter : one must either cut expenditures or raise taxes .
it is already clear , however , that the deficit-reduction agenda , at least in the US , goes further : it is an attempt to weaken social protections , reduce the progressivity of the tax system , and shrink the role and size of government – all while leaving established interests , like the military-industrial complex , as little affected as possible .
in the US ( and some other advanced industrial countries ) , any deficit-reduction agenda has to be set in the context of what happened over the last decade :
· &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; a massive increase in defense expenditures , fueled by two fruitless wars , but going well beyond that ;
· &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; growth in inequality , with the top 1 % garnering more than 20 % of the country ’ s income , accompanied by a weakening of the middle class – median US household income has fallen by more than 5 % over the past decade , and was in decline even before the recession ;
· &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; underinvestment in the public sector , including in infrastructure , evidenced so dramatically by the collapse of New Orleans ’ levies ; and
· &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; growth in corporate welfare , from bank bailouts to ethanol subsidies to a continuation of agricultural subsidies , even when those subsidies have been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization .
as a result , it is relatively easy to formulate a deficit-reduction package that boosts efficiency , bolsters growth , and reduces inequality .
five core ingredients are required .
first , spending on high-return public investments should be increased .
even if this widens the deficit in the short run , it will reduce the national debt in the long run .
what business wouldn ’ t jump at investment opportunities yielding returns in excess of 10 % if it could borrow capital – as the US government can – for less than 3 % interest ?
second , military expenditures must be cut – not just funding for the fruitless wars , but also for the weapons that don ’ t work against enemies that don ’ t exist .
we ’ ve continued as if the Cold War never came to an end , spending as much on defense as the rest of the world combined .
following this is the need to eliminate corporate welfare .
even as America has stripped away its safety net for people , it has strengthened the safety net for firms , evidenced so clearly in the Great Recession with the bailouts of AIG , Goldman Sachs , and other banks .
corporate welfare accounts for nearly one-half of total income in some parts of US agro-business , with billions of dollars in cotton subsidies , for example , going to a few rich farmers – while lowering prices and increasing poverty among competitors in the developing world .
an especially egregious form of corporate special treatment is that afforded to the drug companies .
even though the government is the largest buyer of their products , it is not allowed to negotiate prices , thereby fueling an estimated increase in corporate revenues – and costs to the government – approaching $ 1 trillion dollars over a decade .
another example is the smorgasbord of special benefits provided to the energy sector , especially oil and gas , thereby simultaneously robbing the treasury , distorting resource allocation , and destroying the environment .
then there are the seemingly endless giveaways of national resources – from the free spectrum provided to broadcasters to the low royalties levied on mining companies to the subsidies to lumber companies .
creating a fairer and more efficient tax system , by eliminating the special treatment of capital gains and dividends , is also needed .
why should those who work for a living be subject to higher tax rates than those who reap their livelihood from speculation ( often at the expense of others ) ?
finally , with more than 20 % of all income going to the top 1 % , a slight increase , say 5 % , in taxes actually paid would bring in &amp; nbsp ; more than $ 1 trillion over the course of a decade .
a deficit-reduction package crafted along these lines would more than meet even the most ardent deficit hawk ’ s demands .
it would increase efficiency , promote growth , improve the environment , and benefit workers and the middle class .
there ’ s only one problem : it wouldn ’ t benefit those at the top , or the corporate and other special interests that have come to dominate America ’ s policymaking .
its compelling logic is precisely why there is little chance that such a reasonable proposal would ever be adopted .
a democratic tide seems to be sweeping across the Arab world .
even the traditional Arab monarchies and Emirates are changing in its wake .
Kuwait now allows women to vote , Qatar has embraced an ambitious reform program , Bahrain has shown great tolerance of mass demonstrations , and the U.A.E. is allowing something like a free press .
but Saudi Arabia continues to be deeply wary of any sort of change , and thus remains a huge and seemingly immovable obstacle to region-wide reform .
although the Saudi ruling family , the al-Saud , is under enormous pressure to follow the example of its neighbors , internal resistance to doing so remains very strong .
so the al-Saud have become Janus-faced : looking in one direction , the royal family encourages democratic reformers to speak out ; looking in the opposite direction , it jails them when they do .
on May 15 , in a closed trial without legal representation for the accused , three leading reformers – Ali Al Dumaini , a well-known journalist and poet , and university professors Abdullah Al Hamid and Matruk al Falih – were condemned and sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to nine years .
their crime was to call for a constitutional monarchy .
the official verdict states that they threatened national unity , challenged those in authority , and incited public opinion against the state while using “ foreign , ” that is , Western , terminology .
not long after the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States , these liberal reformers joined with 160 other professionals to write and sign a petition to Crown Prince Abdullah asking for reforms .
the petition called for the monarchy to work within constitutionally prescribed limits , and for an independent judiciary .
the reformers believe that such reforms are the only way for Saudi Arabia to survive the threat of violence , instability , and national fragmentation that is looming on its horizon .
only a constitution , they argue , can restore much needed legitimacy to a political system that is widely perceived as deeply corrupt and inept .
Crown Prince Abdullah , Saudi Arabia ’ s de facto ruler in place of his incapacitated half-brother King Fahd , is keen to be seen as a champion of reform .
he received these proposals with a warm welcome in January 2003 .
but his half-brother and more powerful rival , Prince Naif , the Minister of Interior , ordered the arrests , trial , and imprisonment of 13 reformers in March 2004 .
Crown Prince Abdullah offered not a peep of opposition , leaving the reform agenda that he initiated in a political netherworld .
in order to maintain absolutist power and to minimize public anger , the Saudi princes , led by Prince Naif , asked the reformers to sign an agreement that they would never again ask for reform .
Prince Naif bans the very word “ reform ” from public discourse , because it suggests that there is something wrong with the system ; his preferred term is “ development . ”
of the thirteen reformers who were arrested , ten submitted to this demand , but the other three refused and have paid the price .
they remained in jail in Riyadh without legal representation until the final verdict .
those who submitted had their passports withdrawn , lost their jobs , and were forbidden to speak to the press .
under regional and international pressure , the Saudi ruling family has constructed a Potemkin village of reform while retaining absolute control over all political developments .
earlier this year , they staged partial , and tightly regulated municipal elections , with no independent opinion permitted to influence when and how the ballots were held .
these entire female population was excluded , and only one-quarter of the male population was eligible to vote .
inevitably , Wahhabi Islamists did best .
the al-Saud face two threats : one from violent Islamists , and the other from liberal reformers .
there is every indication that they fear the reformers far more .
perhaps the princes believe that it is easier to kill “ terrorist ” criminals than to crush demands for social justice .
indeed , killing violent Islamists and al-Qaeda affiliates is applauded by the international community , especially the United States , as success in the “ war on terrorism . ”
but as they hunt down and kill violent domestic extremists , they are quietly tightening the noose around all those who want moderate reform .
this repression of liberal reformers passes unnoticed in the wider world , with America ’ s silence particularly noticeable .
this silence is vital to the princes , for what the al-Saud care about most is US support .
as things stand in Saudi Arabia , the US administration has no credible ally for change outside of the existing regime .
so , unlike in Ukraine , Georgia , Kyrgizstan , and Lebanon , it does nothing to encourage popular opposition .
as long as the Saudi regime meets America ’ s oil needs and fights Islamist radicals , it will continue to receive US support and silence – and hence its tacit consent .
but turning a blind eye is shortsighted , for America and for the Saudis .
those who make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable .
the liberal reformers who have been jailed could have paved the way for a peaceful transition to a reformed Saudi Arabia .
by jailing them , the regime has made it clear that violence is the only avenue open to those seeking change .
talk is growing of a change in US defense doctrine to allow for pre-emptive strikes on states that harbor weapons of mass destruction .
that talk is sending shudders across Europe , where many people connect it with America &apos;s oft-stated desire to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq .
ever since the Gulf war , Iraq has been a source of friction among the western permanent members of the UN Security Council .
by the end of 1999 , divergence was complete : the United States and Britain were employing their air power to enforce the no-fly zones while France joined Russia and China in abstaining on resolution 1284 .
as this UK-sponsored resolution was meant to bring the Iraq issue back to the Security Council after the withdrawal of the UN weapons inspectors and subsequent American air strikes of December 1998 , hope for progress on Iraq within the Security Council was scant .
this rapidly changed after last September 11th .
on May 14 , 2002 , the Security Council gave the tottering sanctions regime a new lease on life by unanimously adopting a simplified screening procedure .
even Iraq showed signs of being prepared to consider a possible return of the UN weapons inspectors .
at first sight this seems to bode well for the transatlantic relationship .
in reality , the current relaxation is more likely a lull before the storm .
most Europeans take it for granted that the US will attack Iraq , and that this act of unilateralism , coming in the wake of all the other irritants such as the ABM Treaty , the Kyoto Agreement , the steel tariffs and the International Criminal Court , will have a devastating effect on transatlantic relations .
Europe would be ill-advised to become mesmerized by this approaching disaster .
everyone understands that the Iraqi government &apos;s improved attitude is caused by the Bush administration &apos;s sabre-rattling , but no one can tell whether this is a prelude to an inevitable war or a stratagem to make Iraq cooperate with UN weapons inspectors .
obviously , the US cannot remove this uncertainty without robbing the sabre-rattling of its beneficial effect .
given this ambiguity , there remains time for Europe to engage the US in a serious discussion of the options for dealing with Saddam .
the common aim should be to remove the threat posed by a dictator with so well-documented a predilection for weapons of mass destruction .
the options vary from resumed inspections to `regime change &apos; .
there are arguments which make the choice far less clear-cut than it may seem .
several of these are also being advanced within the Bush administration .
Europe can constructively participate in such discussion provided it first clears the way by :
1. ridding itself of its constantindignation about the conduct of the Bush administration .
that indignation seems strongest among those who have not even bothered to read the American arguments .
Europe does not increase its influence by berating the US for acting in its national interest ;
2. showing some understanding for the view of some in the Bush administration that the US should not be bogged down by a continent that is soft , decadent and moralizing .
this is not a pleasant way of putting it , but many Americans remember how on two occasions in the former Yugoslavia - a pre-eminently European theatre - Europe was helpless until American warplanes showed up ;
3. making clear that Europe and the US areon the same side , not only in the war on terror generally but also in dealing with Saddam .
the demonstrations that will rock European cities the day Iraq is attacked must be counteracted in advance by unequivocal European statements to that effect .
this debate about how to deal with Saddam might go as follows .
it is not difficult to overthrow Saddam , but it is impossible to predict who or what will take his place .
Iraq may even disintegrate , leaving us with a much stronger Iran , also a member of theaxis of evil but one with a more dangerous mix , namely nuclear ambitionsplus fundamentalism .
Moreover , Saddam may already possess a weapon of mass destruction but has been deterred from using it .
once he is attacked by the US , he may use it against Israel , which will retaliate .
so it may well be wiser to induce Iraq to readmit the UN weapons inspectors and make sure they can do their job .
this will not entirely remove the Iraqi threat but will make it controllable .
should this be the outcome , European governments would breathe a sigh of relief .
but the debate may also go the other way .
Saddam will cooperate with UN inspectors only as long as the American threat remains , and the US may conclude that it cannot afford that .
if President Bush then opts for regime change , Europe should not opt out .
this is easier said than done . many Europeans will argue that they cannot condone military action without a Security Council mandate .
but they already did , twice .
they condoned or even supported American air strikes against Baghdad in December 1998 , and they supported or even participated in NATO &apos;s air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in March 1999 .
true , some will say , but that was under the Clinton administration .
if Europe conveys the impression that its friendship with America depends on who wins the US presidential elections , it is likely to freeze the transatlantic relationship for years .
that hardly seems a rational policy for a continent in profound transition .
deeply frustrated by the Bush administration ’ s policies , many people and governments in Europe hope for a fundamental change in American foreign policy after the upcoming presidential election .
but it would take a medium-sized political miracle for these hopes not to be disappointed , and such a miracle will not happen – whoever is elected .
the Bush administration made numerous foreign-policy blunders with far-reaching consequences .
but Bush neither invented American unilateralism nor triggered the transatlantic rift between the United States and Europe .
to be sure , Bush reinforced both trends , but their real causes lie in objective historical factors , namely America ’ s being the sole world power since 1989 and Europe ’ s self-inflicted weakness .
as long as America remains the sole world power , the next US President will be neither able nor willing to change the basic framework of America ’ s foreign policy .
it will , of course , be important who wins the presidency : a candidate expected to continue Bush ’ s foreign policy or someone ready for a new beginning .
in the former case , the transatlantic rift will deepen dramatically .
four , or even eight , more years of US policy à la Bush would inflict such damage on the substance of the transatlantic alliance as to threaten its very existence .
but if America ’ s next president is committed to a new direction , US foreign policy might again become more multilateral , more focused on international institutions and alliances , and willing to bring the relationship between military force and diplomacy back to within its historical proportions .
that is the good news .
the bad news is that , even under such auspicious conditions , the US , as a world power , will not relinquish its “ free-hand ” policy or forget its strength and its claim to preeminence among nations .
another piece of bad ( or good ? ) news is that a more multilateral American policy will increase the pressure on Europeans to take on more responsibility for international crisis management and conflict resolution – in Afghanistan , Iran , Iraq , the Middle East , Transcaucasia , and Russia , and with respect to Turkey ’ s future .
to this common agenda , the Europeans should add Africa , climate change , and reform of the United Nations and the world trading system .
for a long time , Europe has underestimated its weight and importance .
Europe ’ s geopolitical , economic , and social weight is quite obvious .
but Europe ’ s integration of sovereign states ’ interests by means of common institutions could also be an example for much of the world .
in particular , the way Europe , in the process of its enlargement , has projected its power to achieve lasting peace across the whole continent , and fostered development by integrating entire economies , states , and societies within its institutional framework , could become a model for shaping a cooperative world order in the twenty-first century .
this modern , progressive , and peaceful model is unique and superior to all other currently available approaches to the fundamental questions of political order .
but could doesn ’ t mean will .
Europe ’ s global influence is feeble because of its internal quarrels and lack of unity , which render the European Union weak and limit its ability to act .
objectively strong , subjectively infirm – that is how the EU ’ s present condition can be described .
the current moment of American weakness coincides with a substantially changed international political environment , defined largely by the limits of US power , Europe ’ s ineffectiveness , and the emergence of new global giants like China and India .
in light of these developments , does it still make sense to speak of “ the West ” ?
I believe it does , more than ever , because the rift between Europe and America leaves both sides substantially weaker in global terms .
the unilateral overstretching of American power offers a chance for a new beginning in US-European relations .
America , more than in the past , will depend on strong partners and will seek such partnerships .
so what are the Europeans waiting for ?
why not start now to overcome the traditional tension between NATO and the EU – especially as French policy toward NATO under President Nicolas Sarkozy has been moving in the right direction ?
a regular mutual presence of the Secretary General of NATO and of the head of EU foreign policy in the councils of both organizations doesn ’ t require much time and effort .
why not initiate EU-US consultations at a high political level ( with the Secretary-General of NATO participating in security matters ) – for instance , by inviting the US Secretary of State and other members of the administration , such as the Treasury Secretary or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , to sit several times a year on the appropriate EU Council meetings ?
why not have routine annual meetings between the European Council and the US President ?
periodic meetings between the appropriate committees of the US Congress and the European Parliament would also be of great importance , as ultimately both bodies will have to ratify any international treaties .
the fate of the Kyoto Protocol should be a lesson to all parties involved .
no such US-EU consultations would require any new agreements , so they could start without any further preliminaries .
there is one certainty that Europeans can take home from the US election campaign even today : with a more multilaterally oriented US foreign policy , Europe won ’ t be riding comfortably in the US world-political slipstream much longer .
and that is a good thing .
the new transatlantic formula must be greater say in decision-making in exchange for a greater share of responsibility .
America is currently transfixed with the problem it has created for itself in Iraq , but the presidential candidates are also beginning to ask what principles should guide United States foreign policy after Iraq .
in my view , a focus on global public goods – things everyone can consume without diminishing their availability to others – could help America reconcile its preponderant power with others ’ interests .
of course , pure public goods are rare .
most only partially approach the ideal case of clean air , where none can be excluded and all can benefit simultaneously .
combating global climate change is probably the most dramatic current case .
if the largest beneficiary of a public good ( like the US ) does not take the lead in devoting disproportionate resources toward its provision , smaller beneficiaries are unlikely to be able to produce it because of the difficulties of organizing collective action when large numbers are involved .
while this responsibility often lets others become “ free riders , ” the alternative is no ride for anyone .
the US could gain doubly , both from the public goods themselves , and from the way they legitimize its preponderant power in the eyes of others .
America can learn from the lesson the nineteenth century , when Great Britain was a preponderant power and took the lead in maintaining the balance of power between Europe ’ s major states , promoting an open international economic system , and maintaining freedom of the seas .
these issues remain relevant today , and the establishment of rules that preserve access for all remains as much a public good now as it was then , even though some of the issues are more complex .
maintaining regional balances of power and dampening local incentives to use force to change borders provides a public good for many ( but not all ) countries .
similarly , maintaining open global markets is a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for alleviating poverty in poor countries even as it benefits the US .
today , however , global public goods include new issues – not only climate change , but also preservation of endangered species , outer space , and the “ virtual commons ” of cyberspace .
a reasonable consensus in American public opinion supports ensuring both these and the “ classic ” global public goods , even if the US has failed to lead on some issues , notably global climate .
there are also three new dimensions of global public goods in today ’ s world .
first , the US should take the lead in helping to develop and maintain international laws and institutions to organize collective action to deal with not only trade and the environment , but also weapons proliferation , peacekeeping , human rights , and other concerns .
others benefit from the order that such efforts provide , but so does the US .
likewise , while unilateralists complain that the US is constrained by international regimes , so are others .
second , the US should make international development a higher priority .
much of the poor majority of the world is mired in a vicious circle of disease , poverty , and political instability .
financial and scientific help from rich countries is important not only for humanitarian reasons , but also to prevent failed states from becoming sources of disorder for the rest of the world .
here , too , America ’ s record is less than impressive .
protectionist trade measures often hurt poor countries most , and foreign assistance is generally unpopular with the American public .
development will take a long time , and the international community needs to explore better ways to make sure that help actually reaches the poor , but both prudence and a concern for soft power suggest that the US should take the lead .
finally , as a preponderant power , the US can provide an important public good by acting as a mediator and convener .
by using its good offices to mediate conflicts in places like Northern Ireland , Morocco , and the Aegean Sea , the US has helped in shaping international order in ways that are beneficial to other nations .
the Middle East is the crucial current case .
it is sometimes tempting to let intractable conflicts fester , and there are some situations where other countries can play the mediator ’ s role more effectively .
even when the US does not want to take the lead , it can share leadership with others , such as with Europe in the Balkans .
but often the US is the only country that can bring parties together .
when successful , such leadership increases American soft power while reducing sources of instability .
the US can also encourage other countries to share in production of such public goods .
welcoming the rise of Chinese power in terms of that country ’ s becoming a “ responsible stakeholder ” is an invitation to begin such a dialogue .
nevertheless , the US is likely to remain the world ’ s preponderant power even after it extricates itself from Iraq .
but it will have to learn to work with other countries to share leadership .
that will require combining the soft power of attraction with the hard power of military might to produce a “ smart power ” strategy for providing global public goods .
NEWPORT BEACH – Judging from the skittishness of both markets and “ consensus expectations , ” the United States ’ economic prospects are confusing .
one day , the country is on the brink of a double-dip recession ; the next , it is on the verge of a turbo-charged recovery , powered by resilient consumers and US multinationals starting to deploy , at long last , their massive cash reserves .
in the process , markets take investors on a wild rollercoaster ride , with the European crisis ( riddled with even more confusion and volatility ) serving to aggravate their queasiness .
this situation is both understandable and increasingly unsettling for America ’ s well-being and that of the global economy .
it reflects the impact of fundamental ( and historic ) economic and financial re-alignments , insufficient policy responses , and system-wide rigidities that frustrate structural change .
as a result , there are now legitimate questions about the underlying functioning of the US economy and , therefore , its evolution in the months and years ahead .
one way to understand current conditions – and what is needed to improve them – is to consider two events that recently attracted considerable worldwide attention : the launch of Boeing ’ s Dreamliner passenger jet and the tragic death of Apple ’ s Steve Jobs .
let us start with some simple aeronautic dynamics , using an analogy that my PIMCO colleague , Bill Gross , came up with to describe the economic risks facing the American economy .
for the Dreamliner to take off , ascend , and maintain a steady altitude , it must do more than move forward .
it has to move forward fast enough to exceed critical physical thresholds , which are significantly higher than those for most of Boeing ’ s other ( smaller ) planes .
failure would mean succumbing to a mid-air stall , with tepid forward motion giving way to a sudden loss of altitude .
unless we are convinced of the Dreamliner ’ s ability to avoid stall speed , it makes no sense to talk about all the ways in which it will enhance the travel experience for millions of people around the world .
America ’ s economy today risks stall speed .
specifically , the question is not whether it can grow , but whether it can grow fast enough to propel a large economy that , according to the US Federal Reserve , faces “ balance-sheet deleveraging , credit constraints , and household and business uncertainty about the economic outlook . ”
and , remember , it is just over a year since certain US officials were proclaiming the economy ’ s “ summer of recovery ” – a view underpinned by the erroneous belief that America was reaching “ escape velocity . ”
stall speed is a terrifying risk for an economy like that of the US , which desperately needs to grow robustly .
without rapid growth , there is no way to reverse persistently high and increasingly structural ( and therefore protracted ) unemployment ; safely de-leverage over-indebted balance sheets ; and prevent already-disturbing income and wealth inequalities from growing worse .
the private sector alone cannot and will not counter the risk of stall speed .
what is desperately needed is better policymaking .
specifically , policymakers must be open and willing to understand the unusual challenges facing the US economy , react accordingly , and possess sufficiently potent policy instruments .
unfortunately , this has been far from the case in America ( and in Europe , where the situation is worse ) .
Moreover , US policymakers in the last few weeks have been more interested in pointing fingers at Europe and China than in recognizing and responding to the paradigm shifts that are at the root of the country ’ s economic problems and mounting social challenges .
this is where the insights of Steve Jobs , one of the world ’ s best innovators and entrepreneurs , come in .
jobs did more than navigate paradigm shifts ; he essentially created them .
he was a master at converting the complicated into the simple ; and , rather than being paralyzed by complexity , he found new ways to deconstruct and overcome it .
Teamwork was an obligation , not a choice .
and he eschewed the search for the single “ big bang ” in favor of aiming for multiple breakthroughs .
underlying it all was a willingness to evolve – a drive for perfection through experimentation .
Moreover , he excelled at selling to audiences worldwide both his vision and his strategy for realizing it .
so far , America ’ s economic policymakers have fallen short on all of these fronts .
rather than committing to a comprehensive set of urgently-needed reinforcing measures , they seem obsessed with the futile search for the one “ killer app ” that will solve all of the country &apos;s economic problems .
no surprise that they have yet to find it .
Teamwork has repeatedly fallen hostage to turf wars and political bickering .
little has been done to deconstruct structural complexity , let alone win sufficient public support for a medium-term vision , a credible implementation strategy , and a set of measures that is adequate to the task at hand .
the longer the policymaking impasse persists , the greater the stall-speed risk for an economy that already has an unemployment crisis , a large budget deficit , many underwater mortgages , and policy interest rates floored at zero .
this is an atmosphere in which unhealthy balance sheets come under even greater pressure , and healthy investors refuse to engage .
in the process , the risk of recession remains uncomfortably high , the unemployment crisis deepens , and inequities rise as already-stretched social safety nets prove even more porous .
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s petulant remark of last year about &quot; old and new Europe &quot; was right for the wrong reasons .
he meant it to refer to Europe &apos;s divisions , but in May , ten additional states joined the European Union .
the expanded Europe truly forms a new Europe .
should America be nervous ?
Fifty-four years after the announcement of the Schuman Plan that began to knit together the economies of France and Germany , the EU now has 25 countries and a population larger than that of the United States .
eight of the new members are former Communist countries that were locked behind the Iron Curtain for nearly half a century .
their attraction to the Union is a sign of the appeal - the &quot; soft power &quot; - of the idea of European unification .
of course , this new Europe faces many problems .
the per capita income of the new countries is less than half of that of the fifteen members they are joining .
concerns have been raised about the influx of cheap labor .
but average GDP growth rates in the new members are twice as high as in the original members , and this can provide a welcome stimulus to stagnant labor markets and sluggish economies .
political arrangements are somewhat more problematic .
negotiations are underway to revise a draft EU constitution .
some Europeans worry that the constitution will enable courts to carry the integration process further and faster than public opinion in member states will tolerate .
lack of grassroots support might lead to rejection of the constitution in countries like Britain , where referenda have been promised before the new arrangements come into force .
across the Atlantic , most Americans ( to the extent they pay attention ) regard these changes with general approval .
but some express concern that the new Europe will be defined in opposition to the US .
not only do the remarks of French leaders about recreating a multi-polar world arouse alarm , but recent public opinion polls show a decline in the popularity of the US among Europeans and a desire for more independent policies .
the Iraq War proved costly to American soft power , with the US losing about 30 percentage points of attractiveness on average in Europe , including in countries like Britain , Spain , and Italy , whose governments supported the war .
the recent photographs of detainees being abused and sexually degraded in Baghdad &apos;s Abu Ghraib prison added fuel to the fire .
now some American neo-conservatives argue that the US should drop its longstanding support for European integration .
such a policy change would be a serious mistake .
not only would it add to anti-American attitudes and fail to accomplish its objectives , but it over-estimates the extent to which the new Europe is being formed in opposition to the US .
whatever the rhetoric in France , for example , the policies and attitudes in countries such as Britain or Poland demonstrate that good trans-Atlantic relations can be maintained .
if anything , the risks of a US-Europe split will be reduced rather than increased by the EU &apos;s recent enlargement .
Moreover , there are several objective reasons why the current friction between Europe and the US is unlikely to lead to divorce .
for one thing , the divisive war in Iraq may turn out to be the last act of the twentieth century rather than a harbinger of the twenty-first .
American unilateralism is much less in evidence in the world &apos;s other hot spots , such as North Korea and Iran , both because of the costs of the war in Iraq and the realities of the situation in those other regions .
Moreover , while the common security threat from the Soviet Union has disappeared , both the US and Europe face a new common threat from radical jihadist terrorism .
neither side of the Atlantic is immune to the threat , despite the efforts of Osama bin Laden to drive a wedge between Europe and America .
transnational terrorism can only be confronted by close civilian cooperation such as intelligence sharing , police work across borders , and tracing financial flows .
these forms of cooperation survived the divisions over Iraq .
Europe and America also share a common structure of economic interests and values .
while trade produces frictions in democracies , it also enhances wealth .
if one looks at foreign direct investment , it is clear that the two sides of the Atlantic are closely integrated .
in terms of values , while some differences exist between Europe and America , at the fundamental level of democracy and human rights , no other two parts of the globe share more .
as the writer Robert Kagan concluded in the revision of his book in which he declared Europeans to be from Venus and Americans from Mars , it turns out that Americans seeking democratic legitimization of their policies and self-images cannot escape Europe .
in short , it is good for Americans - and for the world - that old and new Europe are becoming one .
we can all benefit from the soft power of an enlarged Europe .
new YORK – Economists generally agree on the advantages of openness in trade .
but the case for non-discrimination in trade is also a compelling one .
so good trade policy should push for multilateral trade liberalization such as at the Doha Round , rather than preferential trade agreements ( PTAs ) such as free-trade areas ( FTAs ) , and also ensure that any retreat into protectionism does not degenerate into discriminatory trade practices .
the last G-20 meeting in Canada was a disappointment on the first front .
at the insistence of the United States , an earlier reference by the G-20 to a definite date for completing the Doha Round was dropped .
instead , unwittingly rubbing salt into the wound , President Barack Obama announced his administration ’ s willingness to see the US-South Korea FTA through .
on the second front , there are distressing recent reports that the US Commerce Department is exploring ways to strengthen the bite of anti-dumping actions , which are now generally agreed to be a form of discriminatory protectionism aimed selectively at successful exporting nations and firms .
equally distressing is Obama ’ s decision in August 13 to sign a bill , approved in a rare special session of the Senate , that raises visa fees on H1 ( b ) and L-1 temporary work visas in order to pay for higher border-enforcement expenditures .
this proposal gained its legs from long-standing worries about the H1 ( b ) and L-1 programs on the part of Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Richard Durbin , and had recently attracted the sponsorship of the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York .
Schumer had long agitated against “ outsourcing ” as inimical to American economic interests , even allying himself with the supply-side economist Paul Craig Roberts .
but he gained clout with the onset of the current crisis , and concern over intractable unemployment numbers is enabling politicians to justify all sorts of superficially attractive remedies .
thus , it was asserted that a tax on foreign workers would reduce the numbers coming in and “ taking jobs away ” from American citizens .
many supporters of the proposal claimed , incoherently , that it would simultaneously discourage foreign workers from entering the US and increase revenues .
Obama ’ s surrender exemplified the doctrine that one retreat often leads to another , with new lobbyists following in others ’ footsteps .
perhaps the chief mistake , as with recent “ Buy American ” provisions in US legislation , was to allow the Employ American Workers Act ( EAWA ) to be folded into the stimulus bill .
this makes it harder for companies to get governmental support to hire skilled immigrants with H1 ( b ) visas : they must first show that they have not laid off or plan to lay off American workers in similar occupations .
whatever the shortcomings of such measures in economic-policy terms , the visa-fee-enhancement provision is de facto discriminatory , and thus violates WTO rules against discrimination between domestic and foreign firms , or between foreign firms from different WTO countries .
while the visa-fee legislation is what lawyers call “ facially ” non-discriminatory , its design confers an advantage on US firms vis-à-vis foreign firms .
the fee applies to both foreign and US firms that employ at least 50 workers , of which 50 % or more are H1 ( b ) workers .
but US firms have additional access to foreign workers under the immigration laws .
India would be the chief loser relative to US firms , and , with several sizeable firms , such as Infosys and Wipro , adversely affected by the measure , it would also be the chief loser vis-à-vis smaller outsourcing firms from other countries .
the Indian government has lost no time in raising these objections – as well as the prospect of a formal WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism complaint .
such acts of discrimination in trade policies find succor in the media and in some of America ’ s prominent think tanks .
for example , in the wake of the vast misery brought by flooding to the people of Pakistan , the US and other governments have risen to the occasion with emergency aid .
but there have also been proposals to grant duty-free access to Pakistan ’ s exports .
but this would be discriminatory toward developing countries that do not have duty-free access , helping Pakistan at their expense .
Astonishingly , Nancy Birdsall of the Center for Global Development , who favors such discrimination , even wrote cynically and approvingly that such a policy “ would have little impact on US textile producers . ”
unfortunately , major US media , including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal , have endorsed this deplorable assault on whatever non-discrimination remains in the world trading system .
is it too unrealistic to hope that the Obama administration , which has so far been far too responsive to weak economics and strong politics , will stand up to these demands ?
Cambridge &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; As the United States ’ epic financial crisis continues to unfold , one can only wish that US policymakers were half as good at listening to advice from developing countries as they are at giving it .
Americans don ’ t seem to realize that their “ sub-prime ” mortgage meltdown has all too much in common with many previous post-1945 banking crises throughout the world .
the silver lining is that there are many highly distinguished current and former policymakers out there , particularly from emerging market countries , who have seen this movie before .
if US policymakers would only listen , they might get an idea or two about how to deal with financial crises from experts who have lived through them and come out safely on the other side .
unfortunately , the parallel between today ’ s US crisis and previous financial crises is not mere hyperbole .
the qualitative parallels are obvious : banks using off-balance loans to finance highly risky ventures , exotic new financial instruments , and excessive exuberance over the promise of new markets .
but there are strong quantitative parallels as well .
professor Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland and I systematically compared the run-up to the US sub-prime crisis with the run-up to the 19 worst financial crises in the industrialized world over the past 60 years .
these include epic crises in the Scandinavian countries , Spain , and Japan , along with lesser events such as the US savings and loan crises of the 1980 ’ s .
across virtually all the major indicators – including equity and housing price runs-ups , trade balance deficits , surges in government and household indebtedness , and pre-crisis growth trajectories – red lights are blinking for the US .
simply put , surging capital flows into the US artificially held down interest rates and inflated asset prices , leading to laxity in banking and regulatory standards and , ultimately , to a meltdown .
when Asia and Latin America had their financial meltdowns in the 1990 ’ s and early 2000 ’ s , they took advice not only from the IMF , but also from a number of small panels composed of eminent people representing diverse backgrounds and experiences .
the US should do the same .
the head of the IMF , Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn , could easily select a superb panel from any range of former crisis countries , including Mexico , Brazil , Korea , Turkey , Japan , and Sweden , not to mention Argentina , Russia , Chile , and many others .
Admittedly , the IMF ’ s panel would have to look past America ’ s current hypocrisy .
the US Treasury strongly encouraged Asia to tighten fiscal policy during its 1990 ’ s crisis .
but today the US Congress and President are tripping over themselves to adopt an ill-advised giant fiscal stimulus package , whose main effects will be to tie the hands of the next president in simplifying the US tax code and closing the budget deficit .
Americans firmly told Japan that the only way to clean up its economy was to purge insolvent banks and regenerate the financial system through Schumpeterian “ creative destruction . ”
today , US authorities appear willing to contemplate any measure , no matter how inflationary , to insure that none of its major banks and investment houses fails .
for years , foreign governments complained about American hedge funds , arguing that their non-transparent behavior posed unacceptable risks to stability .
now , many US politicians are complaining about the transparency of sovereign wealth funds ( big government investors mainly from Asia and the Middle East ) , which are taking shares in trophy American assets such as Citibank and Merrill Lynch .
in fact , having countries like Russia and China more vested in the well-being of the US economy would not be a bad thing .
yes , the IMF ought to develop a voluntary code of conduct for SWF ’ s , but it should not be used as a weapon to enforce financial protectionism .
for years , I , along with many others , have complained that emerging markets need greater representation in global financial governance .
today , the issue goes far beyond symbolism .
the US economy is in trouble , and the problems it spins off are unlikely to stop at the US border .
experts from emerging markets and elsewhere have much to say about dealing with financial crises .
America should start to listen before it is too late .
the IDB , the world &apos;s largest regional development bank , works in Latin America and the Caribbean purportedly to “ contribute to the acceleration of economic and social development . ”
its actions in Haiti , however , have severely undermined those goals .
roughly $ 54 million in IDB loans for water infrastructure in Haiti , home to literally the world ’ s worst water , offered a proven path to preventing deadly water-borne diseases . designed to assist in fulfilling the right to water in the most impoverished nation in the Western Hemisphere , these loans and the lives they could have saved instead have become pawns in a deliberate political power play .
in 2001 , US officials threatened to use their influence to stop previously approved IDB funding unless Haiti ’ s majority political party submitted to political demands to accept a particular apportionment of seats in a Haitian electoral oversight body .
soon after , at the behest of the US , instead of disbursing the loans as planned , the IDB and its members took the unprecedented step of implicitly adding conditions to require political action by Haiti before the funds would be released .
these actions violated the IDB ’ s own charter , which strictly prohibits the Bank and its members from interfering in the internal political affairs of member states .
internal emails reveal that a US legal counselor inside the IDB proposed to the US Treasury Department that , though the loans faced no legitimate technical obstacles , the US could effectively block them by “ slowing ” the process .
indeed , by requesting further review of the loans , Haiti would have to make scheduled payments before the funds were even disbursed . “ While this is not a ‘ bullet-proof ’ way to stop IDB disbursements , ” the counsellor wrote , “ it certainly will put a few more large rocks in the road . ”
in 2001 , then-US Ambassador to Haiti Dean Curran publicly and explicitly linked the withholding of IDB loans to the demand that Haiti ’ s political parties reach a compromise that America wanted .
these tactics worked .
deprived of funds that had already been committed and expected , Haiti fell into arrears on money owed for loan repayment , triggering IDB policies that prevented the Bank from releasing loans .
in subsequent years , the US employed additional delaying tactics , working with the IDB to move the goal posts whenever Haiti appeared to be meeting their demands .
the results have been devastating .
the town of Port-de-Paix , slotted ten years ago by the IDB as the first project site due to its particularly deplorable water situation , has yet to see the implementation of any water projects .
a study conducted by Zanmi Lasante , Partners In Health , the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights , and New York University ’ s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice found no functioning public water sources in the city .
Researchers found three-quarters of water sources in the city contained high levels of coliform bacteria , a key indicator of contamination with fecal matter .
a frightening 15 % of households reported symptoms likely related to typhoid .
if the US and other member states join the IDB and take on the responsibility to improve conditions in the Americas , they cannot then use their membership to undermine the basic rights of the people they claim to serve simply to advance their own political agenda .
the IDB and the US government must take responsibility for their actions and implement the necessary transparency mechanisms to ensure that such abuses do not recur . congressional inquiries and annual reviews of the Treasury Department by the Government Accountability Office could provide the oversight necessary to prevent future political misuse of the IDB and its funds .
the people of Haiti , as well as US taxpayers , deserve a system that makes public the status of IDB loans and projects in Haiti in order to ensure that the US and IDB member states uphold their commitments to development and human rights .
as an American , I am appalled , ashamed , and embarrassed by my country ’ s lack of leadership in dealing with global warming .
scientific evidence on the risks mounts by the day , as most recently documented in England ’ s magisterialStern Report .
yet , despite the fact that the United States accounts for roughly 25 % of all man-made global carbon emissions , Americans show little will or inclination to temper their manic consumption .
the first George W. Bush administration was probably right to refuse to sign the so-called “ Kyoto Protocol , ” albeit for the wrong reasons .
among other problems , the Kyoto Protocol does not go far enough towards redistributing carbon emission rights towards developing countries .
but why can ’ t the US bring itself to raise taxes on gasoline and other sources of carbon emission like coal burning power plants ?
it is not like the US government , running a huge deficit despite an economic boom , does not need the money .
many people seem to think that the Bush administration is the problem .
put a Texas oilman and his buddies in charge and what do you expect , conservation ?
unfortunately , that is a facile excuse .
American citizens ’ resistance to moderating energy consumption for the sake of the global environment is much more deeply embedded .
consider former US Vice President Al Gore , for example , whose documentary film on global warming , An Inconvenient Truth , is celebrated for its unflinching look at how fossil fuel consumption is leading mankind to the brink of catastrophe .
the evidence on global warming is considerably more muddled than Gore ’ s film suggests , but the basic problem is real .
unfortunately , however , Gore was not successful in carrying the torch on global warming when he was a politician .
one cannot commend the 1990 ’ s Clinton-Gore administration for taking any brave steps aimed at radically reducing carbon emissions .
small wonder : the American public is fiercely resistant to anything that seriously forces them to compromise on their energy-burning , gas-guzzling lifestyle .
it is not just politicians who have failed to provide leadership here .
the venerableNew York Times editorial page was apparently opposed to an energy tax until only recently , when the newspaper finally endorsed the idea .
like many liberals , theTimes ’ editors worried that higher energy taxes would fall disproportionately on the poor .
the typical argument one hears is , “ What about the poor guy with the gas-guzzling 1980 Chevy car , who has no other way to get to work ? ” It is a legitimate point , but if ocean levels start rising , as theStern Report predicts , a lot of our children will beswimming to work some day .
the need for corrective measures to alleviate inequality is no excuse for inaction on global warming .
the change of position by theTimes , unfortunately , does not herald an about-face in the American electorate .
mention the idea of an energy tax to any potential 2008 US Presidential candidate , and their faces will pale .
it is fine to say that you care about the environment or to claim , as Bush seems to do , that miracle technologies will solve the problem without too much pain .
but any 2008 Presidential candidate that dares to talk about making sacrifices now for a safer environment later will really be sticking his neck out .
until Americans suck it up and start fixing global environmental problems that they , more than anyone , have caused , it will be difficult to get the wholehearted support of the rest of the world .
developing countries ask why they should pay attention to global warming if rich countries are not prepared to curtail their own emissions sharply ?
why should poor countries worry about how deforestation contributes to global warming when rich countries remain so profligate ?
the scientific evidence suggests that carbon emissions from anywhere in the world have about the same impact on global warming .
for this reason , a wide range of economists favor a uniform ( “ harmonized ” ) global tax that would tax carbon emissions equally everywhere in the world , and from whatever source – whether coal , oil , or gas , and whether consumers or businesses .
such a tax is the most flexible and market-friendly approach , and would have the least impact on economic growth .
instead , the complex system of quotas favored by the Europeans and embodied in the Kyoto Protocol is likely to lead to much larger inefficiencies and costs .
for this reason , England ’ sStern Report is probably far too optimistic when it calculates that an eclectic approach to reducing carbon emissions will cost the world only 1 % per year of income .
but theStern Report is still right to argue that the potential risks of continued inaction are far greater .
America ’ s unwillingness to take the lead on environmental issues may some day be regarded as one of the country ’ s most profound political failures .
one hopes that it changes course soon , before we all are forced to wear swimsuits to work .
AMMAN – Without much fanfare , the past few months have seen no anti-American demonstrations and no burning of American flags across the Arab world .
Arabs seem increasingly willing to accept – and even applaud – the Obama administration ’ s policy toward the region .
of course , Arabs are still unhappy with the United States ’ continued bias towards Israel .
its inability to end the 44-year military occupation of Palestinian lands has not gone unnoticed .
but many Arabs nowadays prefer to give the US a break .
with the exception of the Obama administration ’ s lack of resolve in denouncing the treatment of protesters by the US-allied regimes in Bahrain and Yemen , America ’ s position on the Arab revolts has been welcomed .
Arabs , especially young Arabs , who comprise the majority of the region ’ s population , look up to America for its global power when it upholds democratic morals and values .
there is high respect for the concept of rule of , by , and for the people , as well as for the US Constitution ’ s guarantee of freedom of expression .
it is precisely the failure to apply these values in areas such as Palestine or Iraq that has made – and can still make – countless Arabs vehemently anti-American .
President Barack Obama ’ s election two years ago positively shocked Arabs and empowered Arab democrats , who saw it as proof of America ’ s true democratic nature .
Obama ’ s Cairo speech , delivered on one of his first foreign trips , promised a new US-Arab beginning , and certainly invigorated Arab democrats .
but the first test of Obama ’ s foreign leadership disappointed many Arabs .
a US veto of a Security Council resolution – supported by the Council ’ s 14 other members – to oppose Israeli settlements seemed to signal that Obama had crumbled under pressure from America ’ s pro-Israel lobby .
the US had not revised its policy , even with an African immigrant ’ s son living in the White House .
a more positive view of Obama emerged when the Arab revolts began in Tunisia and Egypt – countries with pro-US regimes .
while the US initially demonstrated prudence in word and deed , it quickly understood that the revolts truly reflected the will of the people and acted to align itself with the democratic cause .
the same people that Obama had called on in his Cairo speech to seek democracy had now formed the most important nonviolent movement the world had seen in decades .
Arab youth had finally moved , and Obama and his team made the right statements to encourage them , while also making it clear to the Egyptian and Tunisian regimes that they could no longer hide behind the claim that they were fighting America ’ s war in north Africa .
pulling away from dictators without trying to take credit for or hijack the revolt was exactly what was required .
Arab youth had to fight and win democracy for themselves .
all that what was wanted from America , most of the young people thought , was withdrawal of its support for allies like Hosni Mubarak and other Arab dictators .
in Libya , however , the need was different .
the same energy on display in Cairo and Tunis was evident among Libyan youth , but this time , America was able to do little diplomatically because it had no relationship with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi .
so , no surprise , the energy of Libyan youth ran head-on into Qaddafi ’ s inclination toward brutality and , more importantly , into his paid mercenaries .
America had a moral responsibility to protect the young people whom Obama had encouraged .
another type of help was needed , but deciding what form it should take was complicated .
Arab countries , especially Egypt , had hundreds of thousands of their nationals working in Libya .
their governments saw themselves as Qaddafi ’ s hostages .
but what the Arab countries couldn ’ t do with military support , they were able to do by providing political cover for the military intervention led by the US , Britain , and France .
the Gulf countries , which have no citizens working in Libya , were the first to denounce Qaddafi .
then the Arab League met to follow the Gulf states ’ lead .
with angry young Arabs from different countries demonstrating outside its Cairo offices and demanding support for their Libyan brethren , the Arab League took an uncharacteristic position : it agreed to denounce a fellow Arab leader .
clearly , the Arab world was changing , and the US was suddenly no longer an enemy , but a friend .
after gaining Security Council support , the US , Europe , and some Arab countries began doing exactly what should be expected of the international community when a government is preparing to butcher its own citizens : prevent the slaughter .
of course , America ’ s problems with Arabs and its challenges in the Middle East are far from over .
Obama must still fulfill his promises to celebrate with Palestinians their full membership of the UN this fall and to draw down its forces in Afghanistan .
but , for the moment , Arabs are not demonstrating against America .
instead , with America ’ s help , they are enjoying the first blush of freedom .
almost all of the world ’ s developed countries consider themselves , and are , social democracies : mixed economies with very large governments performing a wide array of welfare and social insurance functions , and removing large chunks of wealth and commodity distribution from the market .
the United States is something different .
or is it ?
whatever it has been in the past , the US in the future will have to choose whether , and how much , it will be a social democracy .
once upon a time , according to mythology at least , America had little downward mobility .
on the contrary , before the Civil War you could start out splitting rails , light out for the Western Territory , make a success of yourself on the frontier , and wind up as President – if you were named Abraham Lincoln .
in the generation after World War II , you could secure a blue-collar unionized manufacturing job or climb to the top of a white collar bureaucracy that offered job security , relatively high salaries , and long , stable career ladders .
this was always half myth .
setting out for the Western Territory was expensive .
covered wagons were not cheap .
even in the first post-WWII generation , only a minority of Americans – a largely white , male minority – found well-paying stable jobs at large , unionized , capital-intensive manufacturing companies like GM , GE , or AT &amp; T .
but if this story was half myth , it was also half true , particularly in the years after WWII .
largely independent of education or family , those Americans who did value stability and security could grasp it in the form of jobs with “ a future . ”
even for those not so lucky , economic risks were usually fairly low : the unemployment rate for married men during the 1960 ’ s averaged 2.7 % , and finding a new job was a relatively simple matter .
it was during this era – roughly from 1948 to 1973 – that sociologists found that a majority of Americans had come to define themselves not as working class , but as middle class .
the post-WWII period stands as a reference point in America ’ s collective memory , but it was in all likelihood an aberration .
in the early postwar decades , foreign competition exerted virtually no pressure on the economy , owing to the isolation of America ’ s continental market from the devastation of WWII .
at the same time , the war left enormous pent-up demand for the products of mass production : cars , washing machines , refrigerators , lawn mowers , television sets , and more .
government policy back then began with a permanent military program of spending and R &amp; D and continued through massive public works program and suburbanization , underpinned by the Federal Highway Program and subsidized home ownership loans from the Federal Housing Administration .
the regulatory institutions and behavioral norms that originated in the New Deal and developed during WWII came into full force : social security , a system of unionized labor relations , market regulation .
favorable macroeconomic circumstances , the absence of foreign competition , a system of government support and regulation , and large-scale private provision of what in Europe would have been public social insurance all combined to give post-WWII America many of social democracy ’ s benefits without the costs .
the economy did not stagger under the weight of ample benefits or high taxes .
Americans – at least white , male Americans – did not have to worry about tradeoffs between security and opportunity , because the US offered the advantages of both .
corporate welfare capitalism substituted for what in Europe would have been government provided social democracy .
America was thus a special place .
it had its cake and ate it , too : a combination of security with opportunity and entrepreneurship .
it seemed that this was the natural order of things .
hence there was little pressure for government-sponsored social democracy : why bother ?
what would it add ?
now things are very different .
the typical American employer is no longer General Motors .
it is Wal-Mart .
private businesses are providing their workers with less and less in the form of defined-benefit pensions , health insurance , and other forms of insurance against life ’ s economic risks .
sharply rising income inequality has raised the stakes of the economic game .
a government that cannot balance its own finances cannot be relied on to provide macroeconomic stability .
indeed , former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Paul Volcker sees the US as so macroeconomically vulnerable as to be running a 75 % chance of a full-fledged dollar crisis over the next several years .
the coming generation will be one of massive downward mobility for many Americans .
the political struggles that this generates will determine whether America will move more closely to the social democratic norm for developed countries , or find some way to accept and rationalize its existence as a country of high economic risk and deep divisions of income and wealth .

Cambridge – On November 4 , Americans will elect their 44th president amidst the worst financial turmoil the country has known since the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 . both candidates are United States senators with little experience as executives , so their ability to manage the crisis has become a central issue in the election .
at the beginning of the campaign , many observers predicted that Iraq would be the major issue in 2008 .
instead , it is the financial crisis .
in principle , this should help Barack Obama and the Democrats , because polls show them stronger on economic issues , whereas Republicans and John McCain do better on security issues .
after the Republican convention , polls showed McCain ahead in early September , but after the financial meltdown , Obama took the lead .
although both men have warily embraced the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial sector , the contrasts between the two men are sharp .
Obama is not only the first African-American nominee of a major party , but also one of the youngest candidates ever .
McCain has experience as a naval aviator and more than two decades in the Senate .
if elected , he would be the oldest incoming president .
the two men differ in temperament as well as experience .
McCain is a man of strong traditional values who prides himself on his willingness to act quickly and decisively , which he sought to do during the negotiations on the bailout by suspending his campaign to return to Washington .
that effort appears to have backfired , because the Republicans that he leads initially balked at passing the legislation .
but McCain has shown himself to be resilient .
in 2007 , many people wrote off his campaign , but he had the skills to resurrect it and capture the Republican nomination .
his choice of Alaska ’ s Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate shook up the presidential campaign .
Obama , while an inspirational orator , has shown a cool and calm demeanor in responding to both the financial crisis and the turbulence of political campaigning .
when embarrassed by comments made by the pastor of his church , he delivered an exceptional speech about race in America .
if anything , some of Obama ’ s Democratic supporters wish he would show more emotion in responding to criticism .
one should be careful , however , about reading too much into national opinion polls measuring the candidates ’ popular support .
American presidents are elected by an Electoral College in which each state votes in proportion to the number of members it has in Congress .
since even the smallest states have two senators , this leads to overrepresentation of lightly populated Western states that tend to vote Republican .
in 2000 , Al Gore won the popular vote , but George W. Bush prevailed in the electoral college .
thus , the two candidates ’ campaigns are focusing heavily on a dozen or so states in which voters are closely divided and could sway the electoral college outcome .
each campaign is now desperately trying to gauge the impact of the financial crisis on these battleground states .
not only does the Electoral College confuse predictions based on national opinion polls , but there is also the possibility of surprises which can lead to last-minute reversals .
a mistake in a presidential debate can turn the tide of public opinion overnight , as happened to President Gerald Ford in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1976 .
Conversely , Ronald Reagan ’ s performance in his debate with Carter in 1980 is often credited with his victory .
another event that could turn the tables would be an “ October surprise ” associated with terrorism , which could switch the agenda from the financial crisis back to security , the Republicans ’ stronger suit .
in 2004 , shortly before the election , Osama bin Laden released a video tape that may have helped President Bush defeat Senator John Kerry .
from bin Laden ’ s point of view , Bush ’ s policies were more useful for his efforts to recruit supporters than Kerry ’ s might have been .
one would assume that Obama would prove even more unsettling to bin Laden .
a recent BBC poll of 22 countries found that if the world could vote , Obama would win in a landslide .
the pro-Obama margin varied from 82 % in Kenya ( where Obama ’ s father was born ) to 9 % in India .
but Americans do not like outside interference in their elections .
when Obama attracted a crowd of 200,000 to a speech in Berlin last summer , Republicans criticized him as an elitist who appeals to crowds overseas but not to blue-collar workers at home .
on the other hand , in a September poll that asked Americans to rate a series of foreign-policy goals for the next president , 83 % ranked “ improving America ’ s standing in the world ” as most important .
and certainly the election of the first African-American as president would do wonders to restore the soft power that the Bush administration squandered over the past eight years .
some people worry that Obama might be good for American soft power , but not for its hard power .
Machiavelli famously said that it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved .
Machiavelli may be correct , but we sometimes forget that the opposite of love is not fear , but hatred .
and Machiavelli made it clear that hatred is something a prince should carefully avoid .
when the exercise of hard power undercuts soft power , it makes leadership more difficult – as Bush found out after the invasion of Iraq .
both McCain and Obama possess impressive hard-power political and organizational skills ; otherwise , they would not be where they are today .
but when it comes to the soft power skills of emotional intelligence , vision , and communication , Obama outranks McCain .
whether that will sway American voters wary of financial turmoil on November 4 remains to be seen .
Buenos Aires – For 20 years , Americans have denounced the “ crony capitalism ” of Third World countries , especially in Asia .
but , just as those regions have been improving their public and corporate governance – Hong Kong just witnessed a breakthrough court decision against a telecom tycoon who is the son of the province ’ s richest and most powerful man – crony capitalism is taking root in the United States , a country that the world long considered the gold standard of a level playing field in business .
the recently completed “ stress tests ” of US banks are but the latest indication that crony capitalists have now captured Washington , DC .
it is no surprise that stock markets liked the results of the stress tests that US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner administered to America ’ s big banks , for the general outcome had been leaked weeks before .
indeed , most professional investors trashed the tests as dishonest even as their holdings benefited from a rising market .
EvenThe Wall Street Journal , usually financial markets ’ loudest cheerleader , openly disparaged the tests ’ integrity .
the government had allowed bankers to “ negotiate ” the results , like a student taking a final examination and then negotiating her grade .
the tests were supposed to reveal the true conditions of banks saddled with unaudited toxic assets in housing loans and financial derivatives .
the reasoning behind the tests seemed unimpeachable .
but was it ?
as any seasoned banker knows , a well-managed bank should undertake internal “ stress tests ” regularly as a matter of good housekeeping .
the financial crisis should have mandated a running stress test to keep senior management up to date daily . why , then , did the US need the government to conduct a financial exercise that bankers themselves could and should have done far better and faster ?
the truth is that the tests were not designed to find answers .
both Wall Street ’ s chieftains and the Obama administration already knew the truth .
they knew that if the true conditions at many big banks were publicly revealed , many would have been immediately declared bankrupt , necessitating government receivership to stop a tsunami of bank runs .
but the Obama administration did not want to be tagged as “ socialist ” for nationalizing banks , however temporarily , even though experts such as former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker had recommended just that .
Moreover , nationalizing banks would have required dismissing Wall Street captains and their boards for grossly mismanaging their firms .
Wall Street ’ s titans , however , had convinced Obama and his team that their continued stewardship was essential to getting the world out of its crisis .
they successfully portrayed themselves as victims of a firestorm , rather than as accessories to arson .
Geithner and Larry Summers , Obama ’ s chief economic advisor , share Wall Street ’ s culture as protégés of Robert Rubin , the former treasury secretary who went on to serve as a director and senior counselor at Citigroup .
neither man found it difficult to accept the bankers ’ absurd logic .
the stress tests were meant to signal to the public that there was no immediate threat of bank failures .
this message , it was hoped , would stabilize the market so that prices for “ toxic ” assets could rise to a level at which bankers might feel comfortable selling them .
after all , senior bankers had been claiming that these assets were “ mispriced , ” and that pricing them at market levels would penalize the banks unnecessarily .
so far , Geithner seems to have succeeded in his “ tests , ” as the stock market has indeed more than stabilized , with prices of bank shares such as Citigroup and Bank of America quadrupling from their lows .
the feared implosion of Wall Street seems to have been avoided .
but no one ever seriously thought that the US would allow Citigroup and Bank of America , to name just two , to fail .
in fact , the stock market bottomed out last winter .
markets had factored into share prices the belief that the US government would not allow any more banks to collapse .
what the world wanted was an accurate picture of what the banks were worth and “ mark-to-market ” valuations to guide investors as to how much new capital they needed .
the world also wanted to see the US retaking the high road in reinforcing business ethics and integrity – so lacking under the last administration .
as taxpayers had already put huge sums into rescuing failing banks , with the prospect of more to come , a transparent process to reveal how the money was being used was imperative .
substantial public rescue funds have reportedly been siphoned off to foreign banks , Goldman Sachs , and staff bonuses for purposes unrelated to protecting public interests .
none of this was either revealed or debunked by Geithner ’ s tests .
instead , public servants now appear to be in cahoots with Wall Street to engineer an artificial aura of profitability .
Moreover , the value of toxic assets remains as murky as ever .
once sacrosanct accounting principles have been amended at Wall Street ’ s behest in order to allow banks to report essentially whatever they want .
and now negotiated stress test results have been released to “ prove ” that the banks are a lot healthier .
calling this a Ponzi scheme might be too harsh .
but few financial professionals have been fooled .
meanwhile , Wall Street chieftains and their boards of directors have nothing to fear from government .
on the contrary , they are now the government ’ s partners in a joint venture to manage this dishonest scheme .
like swine flu , crony capitalism has migrated from corrupt Third World countries to America , once the citadel of sound public and private governance .
is it any wonder that China is perceived as an increasingly credible model for much of the developing world , while the US is now viewed as a symbol of hypocrisy and double standards ?
NEWPORT BEACH – It has been raised more than 70 times in the last 50 years , mostly without commotion .
it must be raised again this summer if the United States government is to continue paying its bills on time .
but now America ’ s debt ceiling has become the subject of intense political posturing and touch-and-go negotiations behind closed doors .
and , obviously , the outcome has implications that go well beyond the US .
as part of America ’ s system of checks and balances , Congress gets to do more than just approve the annual federal budget .
it also sets a limit on how much debt the US Treasury is allowed to issue .
beyond this ceiling , the government can spend only from current revenues .
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently informed members of Congress that the government will be in this situation on or around August 2 .
having already officially hit the ceiling , the Treasury is moving money around and tapping various pots of unused funds to pay its bills .
in a few weeks , this “ flexibility ” will be used up .
with the US government now borrowing around 40 % of every dollar it spends , a truly binding debt ceiling would immediately force the government to reduce spending radically and in a disorderly fashion .
politicians across the political spectrum know that such a situation would unsettle an already fragile US economy , severely weaken the dollar , and raise serious concerns about the country &apos;s ability to meet its debt-service obligations , including to the many foreign creditors that the US will need in the future .
yet , in today ’ s polarized environment in Washington , Republicans and Democrats are unwilling to compromise – or at least to compromise “ too early . ”
by holding out , Republicans wish to force President Barack Obama ’ s administration into massive spending cuts .
Democrats respond that such a one-sided approach would be economically harmful and socially unjust .
in the meantime , both sides risk disrupting transfer payments ( including to the elderly ) and the provision of public services , as well as eroding further America ’ s global credit standing .
the overwhelming – and sensible – expectation is that the two parties will compromise and raise the debt ceiling before inflicting serious economic and financial dislocations .
the most recent precedent was the bipartisan agreement reached earlier this year on another fiscal issue that threatened to disrupt the normal functioning of government : the absence of a formally approved budget for this year .
a compromise would allow both parties to declare partial victory , for it would likely entail commitments to cut spending and some steps to make taxation more socially just .
but , like many last-minute agreements , it would have little durable impact .
in effect , the political system would again be kicking the can down the road , with real progress on necessary fiscal reforms expected only after the November 2012 presidential election .
two scenarios for the timing of an interim compromise are possible , depending on whether it is a one- or two-step process .
most observers expect a one-step process for bipartisan agreement before August 2 .
but politicians may need two steps : an initial failure to agree , and then a quick deal in response to the resulting financial-market convulsions .
in the meantime , the Treasury would temporarily re-prioritize and slow outgoing payments .
this two-step process would be similar to what happened in 2008 , when Congress was confronted with another cliffhanger : the Bush administration ’ s request for $ 700 billion to prevent a financial-market collapse and an economic depression .
Congress initially rejected the measure , but a dramatic 770-point drop in the stock market focused politicians ’ minds , bringing them back to the table – and to agreement .
but the two-step scenario involves incremental risks to the US economy , and to its standing in the global system .
and the longer America ’ s politicians take to resolve the debt-ceiling issue , the greater the risk of an inadvertent accident .
this brings us to a third , and even more unsettling possibility : a longer and more protracted negotiation , resulting in greater disruptions to government entitlement payments , other contractual obligations , and public services .
creditors would then ask many more questions before adding to their already-considerable holdings of US government debt , generating still more headwinds in a US economy that already faces an unemployment crisis and uneven growth .
the next few weeks will provide plenty of political drama .
the baseline expectation , albeit subject to risk , is that Democrats and Republicans will find a way to avoid disruptions that would damage the fragile US economy , but that the compromise will not meaningfully address the need for sensible medium-term fiscal reforms .
such political paralysis on key economic issues is increasingly unsettling for the US private sector , and for other countries that rely on a strong US at the core of the global economy .
this helps to explain why so many companies continue to hoard cash , rather than investing domestically , and why a growing number of countries want to diversify gradually away from dependence on the dollar as the reserve currency and on US financial markets for intermediation of their hard-earned savings .
the world economy is hard-wired to the assumption of a strong America , and Americans benefit from this .
but the more their politicians argue over the debt ceiling , the greater the risk that the wiring will become irreparably frayed .
the pessimists who have long forecasted that America ’ s economy was in for trouble finally seem to be coming into their own .
of course , there is no glee in seeing stock prices tumble as a result of soaring mortgage defaults .
but it was largely predictable , as are the likely consequences for both the millions of Americans who will be facing financial distress and the global economy .
the story goes back to the recession of 2001 .
with the support of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , President George W. Bush pushed through a tax cut designed to benefit the richest Americans but not to lift the economy out of the recession that followed the collapse of the Internet bubble .
given that mistake , the Fed had little choice if it was to fulfill its mandate to maintain growth and employment : it had to lower interest rates , which it did in an unprecedented way – all the way down to 1 % .
it worked , but in a way fundamentally different from how monetary policy normally works .
usually , low interest rates lead firms to borrow more to invest more , and greater indebtedness is matched by more productive assets .
but , given that overinvestment in the 1990 ’ s was part of the problem underpinning the recession , lower interest rates did not stimulate much investment .
the economy grew , but mainly because American families were persuaded to take on more debt , refinancing their mortgages and spending some of the proceeds .
and , as long as housing prices rose as a result of lower interest rates , Americans could ignore their growing indebtedness .
in fact , even this did not stimulate the economy enough .
to get more people to borrow more money , credit standards were lowered , fueling growth in so-called “ subprime ” mortgages .
Moreover , new products were invented , which lowered upfront payments , making it easier for individuals to take bigger mortgages .
some mortgages even had negative amortization : payments did not cover the interest due , so every month the debt grew more .
fixed mortgages , with interest rates at 6 % , were replaced with variable-rate mortgages , whose interest payments were tied to the lower short-term T-bill rates .
what were called “ teaser rates ” allowed even lower payments for the first few years : they were teasers , because they played off the fact that many borrowers were not financially sophisticated , and didn ’ t really understand what they were getting into .
and Alan Greenspan egged them to pile on the risk by encouraging these variable-rate mortgages .
on February 23 , 2004 , he pointed out that “ many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable-rate mortgages rather than fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade . ”
but did Greenspan really expect interest rates to remain permanently at 1 % – a negative real interest rate ?
did he not think about what would happen to poor Americans with variable-rate mortgages if interest rates rose , as they almost surely would ?
of course , Greenspan ’ s behavior meant that under his watch , the economy performed better than it otherwise would have .
but it was only a matter of time before that performance became unsustainable .
Fortunately , most Americans did not follow Greenspan ’ s advice to switch to variable-rate mortgages .
but even as short-term interest rates began to rise , the day of reckoning was postponed , as new borrowers could obtain fixed-rate mortgages at interest rates that were not increasing .
remarkably , as short-term interest rates rose , medium- and long-term interest rates did not , something that was referred to as a “ conundrum . ”
one hypothesis is that foreign central banks that were accumulating trillions of dollars finally figured out that they were likely to be holding these reserves for years to come , and could afford to put at least some of the money into medium-term US treasury notes yielding ( initially ) far higher returns than T-bills .
the housing price bubble eventually broke , and , with prices declining , some have discovered that their mortgages are larger than the value of their house .
others found that as interest rates rose , they simply could not make their payments .
too many Americans built no cushion into their budgets , and mortgage companies , focusing on the fees generated by new mortgages , did not encourage them to do so .
just as the collapse of the real estate bubble was predictable , so are its consequences : housing starts and sales of existing homes are down and housing inventories are up .
by some reckonings , more than two-thirds of the increase in output and employment over the past six years has been real estate-related , reflecting both new housing and households borrowing against their homes to support a consumption binge .
the housing bubble induced Americans to live beyond their means – net savings has been negative for the past couple of years .
with this engine of growth turned off , it is hard to see how the American economy will not suffer from a slowdown .
a return to fiscal sanity will be good in the long run , but it will reduce aggregate demand in the short run .
there is an old adage about how people ’ s mistakes continue to live long after they are gone .
that is certainly true of Greenspan .
in Bush ’ s case , we are beginning to bear the consequences even before he has departed .
new YORK – America ’ s political and economic crisis is set to worsen following the upcoming November elections .
President Barack Obama will lose any hope for passing progressive legislation aimed at helping the poor or the environment .
indeed , all major legislation and reforms are likely to be stalemated until 2013 , following a new presidential election .
an already bad situation marked by deadlock and vitriol is likely to worsen , and the world should not expect much leadership from a bitterly divided United States .
much of America is in a nasty mood , and the language of compassion has more or less been abandoned .
both political parties serve their rich campaign contributors , while proclaiming that they defend the middle class .
neither party even mentions the poor , who now officially make up 15 % of the population but in fact are even more numerous , when we count all those households struggling with health care , housing , jobs , and other needs .
the Republican Party recently issued a “ Pledge to America ” to explain its beliefs and campaign promises .
the document is filled with nonsense , such as the fatuous claim that high taxes and over-regulation explain America ’ s high unemployment .
it is also filled with propaganda .
a quotation by President John F. Kennedy states that high tax rates can strangle the economy , but Kennedy ’ s was speaking a half-century ago , when the top marginal tax rates were twice what they are today .
most of all , the Republican platform is devoid of compassion .
America today presents the paradox of a rich country falling apart because of the collapse of its core values .
American productivity is among the highest in the world .
average national income per person is about $ 46,000 – enough not only to live on , but to prosper .
yet the country is in the throes of an ugly moral crisis .
income inequality is at historic highs , but the rich claim that they have no responsibility to the rest of society .
they refuse to come to the aid of the destitute , and defend tax cuts at every opportunity .
almost everybody complains , almost everybody aggressively defends their own narrow and short-term interests , and almost everybody abandons any pretense of looking ahead or addressing the needs of others .
what passes for American political debate is a contest between the parties to give bigger promises to the middle class , mainly in the form of budget-busting tax cuts at a time when the fiscal deficit is already more than 10 % of GDP .
Americans seem to believe that they have a natural right to government services without paying taxes .
in the American political lexicon , taxes are defined as a denial of liberty .
there was a time , not long ago , when Americans talked of ending poverty at home and abroad .
Lyndon Johnson ’ s War on Poverty in the mid-1960 ’ s reflected an era of national optimism and the belief that society should make collective efforts to solve common problems , such as poverty , pollution , and health care .
America in the 1960 ’ s enacted programs to rebuild poor communities , to fight air and water pollution , and to ensure health care for the elderly .
then the deep divisions over Vietnam and civil rights , combined with a surge of consumerism and advertising , seemed to end an era of shared sacrifice for the common good .
for 40 years , compassion in politics receded .
Ronald Reagan gained popularity by cutting social benefits for the poor ( claiming that the poor cheated to receive extra payments ) .
bill Clinton continued those cuts in the 1990 ’ s .
today , no politician even dares to mention help for poor people .
the big campaign contributors to both parties pay to ensure that their vested interests dominate political debates .
that means that both parties increasingly defend the interests of the rich , though Republicans do so slightly more than Democrats .
even a modest tax increase on the rich is unlikely to find support in American politics .
the result of all of this is likely to be a long-term decline of US power and prosperity , because Americans no longer invest collectively in their common future .
America will remain a rich society for a long time to come , but one that is increasingly divided and unstable .
fear and propaganda may lead to more US-led international wars , as in the past decade .
and what is happening in America is likely to be repeated elsewhere .
America is vulnerable to social breakdown because it is a highly diverse society .
Racism and anti-immigrant sentiments are an important part of the attack on the poor , or at least the reason why so many are willing to heed the propaganda against helping the poor .
as other societies grapple with their own increasing diversity , they may follow the US into crisis .
Swedes recently gave enough votes to a right-wing , anti-immigrant party to give it representation in parliament , reflecting a growing backlash against the rising number of immigrants in Swedish society .
in France , Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s government has tried to regain popularity with the working class by deporting Roma migrants , a target of widespread hatred and ethnic attacks .
both examples show that Europe , like the US , is vulnerable to the politics of division , as our societies become more ethnically diverse .
the lesson from America is that economic growth is no guarantee of wellbeing or political stability .
American society has become increasingly harsh , where the richest Americans buy their way to political power , and the poor are abandoned to their fate .
in their private lives , Americans have become addicted to consumerism , which drains their time , savings , attention , and inclination to engage in acts of collective compassion .
the world should beware .
unless we break the ugly trends of big money in politics and rampant consumerism , we risk winning economic productivity at the price of our humanity .
BERKELEY – There are always two paths to boost employment in the short term .
the first path is to boost demand for goods and services , and then sit back and watch employment rise as businesses hire people to make the goods and services to meet that demand .
the second path is not to worry about production of goods and services , but rather to try to boost employment directly through direct government hiring .
the first path is better : not only do you get more jobs , but you also get more useful stuff produced .
the problem is that it does not take effect very quickly .
it is subject to what Milton Friedman called “ long and variable lags . ”
thus , policies aimed at boosting employment by the end of , say , this calendar year needed to be put in place about a year ago to have time to have reached their full effect .
some countries – China , for example – did , indeed , implement such job-creation policies a year ago and are already seeing the benefits .
others , like the United States , did not , and so unemployment remains at around 10 % .
this is not to say that the Obama administration did not try to boost employment .
a year ago , it set five policy initiatives in motion :
• Additional deficit spending ;
• Recapitalization of banks that appeared very vulnerable ;
• Asset purchases by the US Treasury and other executive-branch entities to reduce the quantity of risky assets that the battered and risk-intolerant private sector was holding ;
• Continued monetary easing via very low Federal Funds rates ;
• Expansion of extraordinary policy interventions by the Federal Reserve .
the stress tests conducted by the US Treasury last year suggested that the banking sector had re-attained sufficient capital .
and the Fed has continued its low-interest monetary policy .
but the dysfunctional US Senate capped additional deficit spending at $ 600 billion over three years – only half of the $ 1.2 trillion that was the technocratic goal .
Moreover , the Fed became gun-shy and did not continue to increase its balance sheet beyond $ 2 trillion .
and large-scale market interventions funded and guided by the Treasury never came to pass on a sufficiently large scale to have any tangible effect on jobs .
in short , perhaps two and a half out of the Obama administration ’ s five policy initiatives came to fruition .
and , in the face of a recessionary crisis that turned out to be roughly twice as large as was forecast at the end of 2008 , such limited action was not enough to keep the US unemployment rate below 10 % – or even set it on a downward trajectory .
this brings us to the present moment , with US unemployment unacceptably high and refusing to fall .
as a result , there is now a very strong case to turn the focus of the US economy from measures aimed at increasing demand to measures aimed at boosting employment directly ( without worrying much about whether these measures are efficient in the sense of substantially raising the quantity of goods and services produced ) .
in practice , that means that the government either hires people and puts them to work or induces businesses to hire more people .
we are talking about either direct government employment programs , or large tax credits for businesses that increase the number of workers they employ .
there is still time for a substantial shift in federal spending toward high-employment ( but in all likelihood low-value ) projects to reduce unemployment before the end of 2010 – if Congress acts quickly .
and there is still time for a substantial temporary and incremental new-hire tax credit aimed at getting businesses to boost employment before the end of 2010 .
but will Congress act quickly ?
given the depth of political polarization in the US , and thus the need for 60 of 100 votes in the Senate to end a Republican filibuster , there is no sign of it being able to do so .
such a plan can get off the ground only if 50 Democratic senators are willing to rely on the budget reconciliation process – used to combine the bills adopted by the House of Representatives and the Senate – and are willing to accelerate that process and complete it within a month .
don ’ t hold your breath .
many of today ’ s war zones – including Afghanistan , Ethiopia , Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Somalia , and Sudan – share basic problems that lie at the root of their conflicts .
they are all poor , buffeted by natural disasters – especially floods , droughts , and earthquakes – and have rapidly growing populations that are pressing on the capacity of the land to feed them .
and the proportion of youth is very high , with a bulging population of young men of military age ( 15-24 years ) .
all of these problems can be solved only through long-term sustainable economic development .
yet the United States persists in responding to symptoms rather than to underlying conditions by trying to address every conflict by military means .
it backs the Ethiopian army in Somalia .
it occupies Iraq and Afghanistan .
it threatens to bomb Iran .
it supports the military dictatorship in Pakistan .
none of these military actions addresses the problems that led to conflict in the first place .
on the contrary , American policies typically inflame the situation rather than solve it .
time and again , this military approach comes back to haunt the US .
the US embraced the Shah of Iran by sending massive armaments , which fell into the hands of Iran ’ s Revolutionary Government after 1979 .
the US then backed Saddam Hussein in his attack on Iran , until the US ended up attacking Saddam himself .
the US backed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan against the Soviets , until the US ended up fighting bin Laden .
since 2001 the US has supported Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan with more than $ 10 billion in aid , and now faces an unstable regime that just barely survives .
US foreign policy is so ineffective because it has been taken over by the military .
even postwar reconstruction in Iraq under the US-led occupation was run by the Pentagon rather than by civilian agencies .
the US military budget dominates everything about foreign policy .
adding up the budgets of the Pentagon , the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , the Department of Homeland Security , nuclear weapons programs , and the State Department ’ s military assistance operations , the US will spend around $ 800 billion this year on security , compared with less than $ 20 billion for economic development .
in a stunning article on aid to Pakistan during the Bush administration , Craig Cohen and Derek Chollet demonstrated the disastrous nature of this militarized approach – even before the tottering Musharraf regime ’ s latest crackdown .
they show that even though Pakistan faces huge problems of poverty , population , and environment , 75 % of the $ 10 billion in US aid has gone to the Pakistani military , ostensibly to reimburse Pakistan for its contribution to the “ war on terror , ” and to help it buy F-16s and other weapons systems .
another 16 % went straight to the Pakistani budget , no questions asked .
that left less than 10 % for development and humanitarian assistance .
annual US aid for education in Pakistan has amounted to just $ 64 million , or $ 1.16 per school-aged child .
the authors note that “ the strategic direction for Pakistan was set early by a narrow circle at the top of the Bush administration and has been largely focused on the war effort rather than on Pakistan ’ s internal situation . ” They also emphasize that “ US engagement with Pakistan is highly militarized and centralized , with very little reaching the vast majority of Pakistanis . ”
they quote George Bush as saying , “ When &#91; Musharraf &#93; looks me in the eye and says … there won ’ t be a Taliban and won ’ t be al-Qaeda , I believe him , you know ? ”
this militarized approach is leading the world into a downward spiral of violence and conflict .
each new US weapons system “ sold ” or given to the region increases the chances of expanded war and further military coups , and to the chance that the arms will be turned on the US itself .
none of it helps to address the underlying problems of poverty , child mortality , water scarcity , and lack of livelihoods in places like Pakistan ’ s Northwest Frontier Province , Sudan ’ s Darfur region , or Somalia .
these places are bulging with people facing a tightening squeeze of insufficient rainfall and degraded pasturelands .
naturally , many join radical causes .
the Bush administration fails to recognize these fundamental demographic and environmental challenges , that $ 800 billion of security spending won ’ t bring irrigation to Afghanistan , Pakistan , Sudan , and Somalia , and therefore won ’ t bring peace .
instead of seeing real people in crisis , they see caricatures , a terrorist around every corner .
a more peaceful world will be possible only when Americans and others begin to see things through the eyes of their supposed enemies , and realize that today ’ s conflicts , having resulted from desperation and despair , can be solved through economic development rather than war .
we will have peace when we heed the words of President John F. Kennedy , who said , a few months before his death , “ For , in the final analysis , our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet .
we all breathe the same air .
we all cherish our children ’ s future .
and we are all mortal . ”
BERKELEY – In 1950 , finance and insurance in the United States accounted for 2.8 % of GDP , according to US Department of Commerce estimates .
by 1960 , that share had grown to 3.8 % of GDP , and reached 6 % of GDP in 1990 .
today , it is 8.4 % of GDP , and it is not shrinking .
the Wall Street Journal ’ s Justin Lahart reports that the 2010 share was higher than the previous peak share in 2006 .
Lahart goes on to say that growth in the finance-and-insurance share of the economy has “ not , by and large , been a bad thing .... Deploying capital to the places where it can be best used helps the economy grow ... ”
but if the US were getting good value from the extra 5.6 % of GDP that it is now spending on finance and insurance – the extra $ 750 billion diverted annually from paying people who make directly useful goods and provide directly useful services – it would be obvious in the statistics .
at a typical 5 % annual real interest rate for risky cash flows , diverting that large a share of resources away from goods and services directly useful this year is a good bargain only if it boosts overall annual economic growth by 0.3 % – or 6 % per 25-year generation .
there have been many shocks to the US economy over the past couple of generations , and many factors have added to or subtracted from economic growth .
but it is not obvious that the US economy today would be 6 % less productive if it had had the finance-insurance system of 1950 rather than the one that prevailed during the past 20 years .
there are five ways that an economy gains from a well-functioning finance-insurance system .
first , people are no longer as vulnerable to the effects of fires , floods , medical disasters , unemployment , business collapses , sectoral shifts , and so forth , because a well-working finance-insurance system diversifies and thus dissipates some risks , and deals with others by matching those who fear risk with those who can comfortably bear it .
while it might be true that America ’ s current finance-insurance system better distributes risk in some sense , it is hard to see how that could be the case , given the experience of investors in equities and housing over the past two decades .
second , well-functioning financial systems match large , illiquid investment projects with the relatively small pools of money contributed by individual savers who value liquidity highly .
there has been one important innovation over the past two generations : businesses can now issue high-yield bonds .
but , given the costs of the bankruptcy process , it has never been clear why a business would rather issue high-yield bonds ( besides gaming the tax system ) , or why investors would rather buy them than take an equity stake .
third , improved opportunities to borrow allow one to spend more now , when one is poor , and save more later , when one is rich .
households are certainly much more able to borrow , thanks to home-equity loans , credit-card balances , and payday loans .
but what are they really buying ?
many are not buying the ability to spend when they are poor and save when they are rich , but instead appear to be buying postponement of the “ unpleasant financial retrenchment ” talk with the other members of their household .
and that is not something you want to buy .
fourth , we have seen major improvements in the ease of transactions .
but , while electronic transactions have made a great deal of financial life much easier , this should have been accompanied by a decrease , not an increase , in the finance share of GDP , just as automated switching in telecommunications led to a decrease in the number of telephone switchboard operators per phone call . indeed , the operations of those parts of the financial system most closely related to technological improvements have slimmed down markedly : consider what has happened to the checking operations of the regional Federal Reserve Banks .
finally , better finance should mean better corporate governance .
since shareholder democracy does not provide effective control over entrenched , runaway , self-indulgent management , finance has a potentially powerful role to play in ensuring that corporate managers work in the interest of shareholders .
and a substantial change has indeed occurred over the past two generations : CEOs focus much more attention than they used to on pleasing the stock market , and this is likely to be a good thing .
overall , however , it remains disturbing that we do not see the obvious large benefits , at either the micro or macro level , in the US economy ’ s efficiency that would justify spending an extra 5.6 % of GDP every year on finance and insurance .
Lahart cites the conclusion of New York University ’ s Thomas Philippon that today ’ s US financial sector is outsized by two percentage points of GDP .
and it is very possible that Philippon ’ s estimate of the size of the US financial sector ’ s hypertrophy is too small .
why has the devotion of a great deal of skill and enterprise to finance and insurance sector not paid obvious economic dividends ?
there are two sustainable ways to make money in finance : find people with risks that need to be carried and match them with people with unused risk-bearing capacity , or find people with such risks and match them with people who are clueless but who have money .
are we sure that most of the growth in finance stems from a rising share of financial professionals who undertake the former rather than the latter ?
Denver – Patience might be a virtue , but not necessarily when it comes to American foreign policy .
consider “ the long war , ” a bold concept embraced a few years ago to describe the continuing struggle against terrorism , the grudging progress that could realistically be achieved , and the enormous financial burden that it would impose for years to come .
it was also a realpolitik acknowledgement of the setbacks to be expected along the way ( the “ slog , ” as then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it ) .
above all , the term was an effort to communicate to Americans , accustomed to waging war with speed and decisiveness ( and insistent on it since Vietnam ) , the long-term sacrifice and commitment needed to win a war of survival .
its proponents also understood that the war would not be limited to weapons , but would need to be a sustained effort , involving , as they put it , the “ whole of government , ” with civilian agencies marshaled behind military – or paramilitary – objectives .
daunting as the effort would be , its advocates assumed a sustainable political consensus to support it .
after all , the United States had been attacked .
today , that consensus is unraveling as America ’ s politicians wrestle with a federal budget that is itself turning into a long war – one with its own casualties .
the battle lines in this struggle suggest that there is little accord among political elites for any spending , let alone for a long war with far-flung commitments .
as a result , basic assumptions are being questioned at every turn .
indeed , the current budget war seems to be reopening old divisions about America ’ s view of itself and the world .
the outcome is far from certain , but even isolationism , a perennial American malady , seems to be making a comeback .
isolationism is a familiar refrain in US foreign policy among those elements of the right that consider the US too good for the world , as well as among those on the left who consider America a destructive global force .
but this time , as perhaps never before , a bipartisan isolationist impulse is being driven by the budget .
America ’ s fiscal crisis is profound , and it is not just about numbers .
as the emotions in Washington today suggest , the aversion to tax increases runs far deeper than concern about their effect on current economic performance and job growth .
in part , it represents a fundamental – some would say fundamentalist – view that taxes are to government what a bottle of whisky is to an alcoholic .
government , as Ronald Reagan told us , is the problem , not the solution .
that message is bad news for American diplomacy .
the linkage between politicians ’ unwillingness to fund domestic programs and the imperiled commitment to “ the long war ” might elude those in US foreign-policy circles , but it is not lost on the rest of the country .
opinion surveys suggest that Americans want to maintain many of the “ discretionary ” domestic programs – schools , hospitals , transportation infrastructure , recreational parks , etc . – that are now on the chopping block in budget negotiations .
in places like rural El Paso County , on the eastern plains of Colorado , far from the federal budget debate ’ s epicenter , spending cuts are the order of the day .
school districts are increasing class sizes as they shed teachers , as well as deferring maintenance projects and curtailing the school-bus service .
these cuts are having a very real and immediate impact on El Paso County ’ s residents .
can they , and other Americans who are losing vital services , really be expected to rise above it all and support funding to build new schools in Afghanistan ?
not only are America ’ s public schools starting to look second-rate , but so is its infrastructure , which had long been a source of national pride .
how many travelers nowadays can fail to note the difference between Asia ’ s new , efficient airports and the aging , clogged antiques in some major US cities ?
the budget war is not producing any consensus on fixing America ’ s infrastructure , but it is beginning to produce a view that Afghanistan and Pakistan are far from being core US national interests .
why , people ask , are schools and roads in Afghanistan and Iraq more important than those in Colorado or California ?
at one point in 2008 , the US military picked up the cost of transporting a tiger for the Baghdad zoo .
when was the last time the US government did that for a US zoo ( outside of Washington , of course ) ?
how this debate sorts itself out will have profound consequences for how America conducts itself in the world .
but it might also take a toll on how the world reacts to America ’ s fastest-growing export : unsolicited advice .
countries take others ’ advice for many reasons .
sometimes they respect the adviser ’ s wisdom and insights ( fairly rare in diplomacy ) .
or they might fear the consequences of not taking the advice ( an offer one cannot refuse , so to speak ) .
or , as is true of many of America ’ s diplomatic transactions , accepting advice could open the way to a better relationship and to additional assistance .
in short , diplomacy – and US diplomacy , in particular – often involves money .
but what if there is no money to offer ?
what if Americans , tired of the budget cuts in their neighborhoods , refuse to support funds even for “ the long war ” ?
at that point , senior US officials might well arrive in a country , offer advice , and find that nobody is bothering to listen .
new YORK – The 2008 financial crisis marked the end of the global order as we knew it .
in advance of the upcoming G-8 summit , it is impossible to overlook the fact that , for the first time in seven decades , the United States cannot drive the international agenda or provide global leadership on all of today ’ s most pressing problems .
indeed , the US has trimmed its presence abroad by refusing to contribute to a eurozone bailout , intervene in Syria , or use force to contain Iran ’ s nuclear breakout ( despite strong Israeli support ) .
President Barack Obama officially ended the war in Iraq , and is withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan at a pace constrained only by the need to save face .
America is handing off the leadership baton – even if no other country or group of countries is willing or able to grasp it .
in short , US foreign policy may be as active as ever , but it is downsizing and becoming more exacting about its priorities .
as a result , many global challenges – climate change , trade , resource scarcity , international security , cyber-warfare , and nuclear proliferation , to name a few – are bound to loom larger .
welcome to the G-Zero world , a more turbulent , uncertain environment in which coordination on global policy issues falls by the wayside .
paradoxically , this new environment , though daunting , is less troublesome for the US ; in fact , it provides fresh opportunities for the US to capitalize on its unique position .
the G-Zero world is not all bad for the US – if it plays its cards right .
many residual strengths take on greater importance in such a world , and America remains the world ’ s only true superpower and its largest economy – still more than twice the size of China ’ s .
its defense expenditures represent nearly half the world total , and exceed those of the next 17 countries combined .
the dollar remains the world ’ s reserve currency , and investors ’ scramble into US government debt at every peak in the crisis since 2008 has underscored America ’ s safe-haven status ( even in crises that America caused ) .
likewise , the US continues to lead in entrepreneurship , research and development , higher education , and technological innovation .
Moreover , it is now the world ’ s largest natural-gas producer and calorie exporter , which has reduced its vulnerability to price shocks or food shortages .
no country rivals America ’ s promotion of the rule of law , liberal democracy , transparency , and free enterprise .
while other countries certainly support these values , only the US has been willing , healthy , and big enough to ensure that they prevail .
so , as America curtails its global leadership , it will find itself in more demand .
consider Asia , for example . &amp; nbsp ; As China ’ s economic importance and regional influence grows , its neighbors are seeking to deepen ties with the US .
Japan , Australia , Indonesia , and Taiwan have all recently closed trade and security-related deals with the US .
even Burma has gotten on board , resuming diplomatic engagement with the US while trying to work its way out of China ’ s shadow .
in other words , in a G-Zero world , an increasingly aggressive global environment makes the US all the more appealing to countries seeking to hedge their bets . &amp; nbsp ; As a result , the US has an opportunity to act more precisely in its own interests .
supplying less leadership allows the US to weigh opportunity costs before taking action , and to select the issues and circumstances that suit it the best . &amp; nbsp ; In this environment , military intervention in Libya does not necessitate the same in Syria .
the extent to which the US will capitalize on these opportunities remains to be seen .
in fact , America ’ s short-term advantages pose the biggest obstacle to its long-term outlook .
call this the “ safe-haven curse ” : &amp; nbsp ; as long as the US remains the safest port in any storm , it faces no immediate pressure to address its weaknesses .
for example , for all of the hand-wringing about America ’ s national debt , investors will continue to loan the US money .
over the long term , however , US policymakers must make steady progress in restoring confidence in the nation ’ s fiscal health by cutting politically sacred programs like social security , Medicare , and defense .
officials will have to put aside short-term motives and party orthodoxy to bolster America ’ s aging infrastructure , reform its education and immigration systems , and pursue long-term fiscal consolidation .
America ’ s advantages in the G-Zero world afford it the chance to invest in the future .
but , by cushioning against sufficiently calamitous risks , the same advantages allow the US to procrastinate .
American politicians need to recognize the new G-Zero reality and rebuild America ’ s domestic sources of strength , even if only incrementally . &amp; nbsp ; If they do , the US will have the vigor and flexibility to shape the next world order .
America ’ s political system usually works well in crises . &amp; nbsp ; But , thanks to its residual advantages in a leaderless world , the US need not rely on a crisis to precipitate action .
it need only seize the G-Zero moment .
London – Groucho Marx has always been my favorite Marxist .
one of his jokes goes to the heart of the failure of the ideology – the dogmatic religion – inflicted on our poor world by his namesake , Karl .
“ Who are you going to believe , ” Groucho once asked , “ me , or your own eyes ? ” For hundreds of millions of citizens in Communist-run countries in the twentieth century , the “ me ” in the question was a dictator or oligarchy ruling with totalitarian or authoritarian powers .
it didn ’ t matter what you could see with your own eyes .
you had to accept what you were told the world was like .
reality was whatever the ruling party said it was .
the designated successor to Mao Zedong in China , Hua Guofeng , raised this attitude to an art form .
he was known as a “ whateverist . ”
the Party and people should faithfully follow whatever Mao instructed them to do .
Groucho posed two insuperable problems for the “ whateverists ” of communism .
first , your own eyes and your reason would surely tell you before long that the communist idyll – the withering away of the state and the triumph over need – would never come .
communism , like the horizon , was always just beyond reach .
it would be interesting to know how many of those at Beijing ’ s Central Party School – the party ’ s main educational institute – believe that the Chinese state is about to wither away , or ever will .
the second application of Groucho ’ s question was that citizens of most Communist countries soon learned that the loss of freedom that they suffered was not compensated by greater prosperity or a higher quality of life .
the more that Russians , Poles , Czechs , and others saw of the life-style in the Western democracies , the more they questioned their own system .
in his magisterial bookThe Rise and Fall of Communism , Archie Brown notes how travel abroad opened Mikhail Gorbachev ’ s eyes to the failure of the system that he had lived under all his life .
so , in the political sphere , reason has trumped both faith in an unattainable goal and self-delusion about the consequences of its pursuit .
authoritarian party-states , such as China and Vietnam , survive , but not through commitment to communism .
their legitimacy depends on their ability to deliver economic growth through state-managed capitalism .
democracies , of course , allow people to use their reason to make choices based on the evidence of their own eyes .
when you don ’ t like a government , you can turn the rascals out without overthrowing the whole system .
change can be made in an evolutionary , rather than a revolutionary , way .
but no one should think that debate in democracies is always based on reason , or that democracy necessarily makes people more rational .
sometimes reason does prevail .
this is what appeared to happen in the last Indian election , and the election in the United States of President Barack Obama was also plainly a supremely rational moment .
but reason does not seem to be getting much of a hearing during the current health-care debate in the US .
outsiders , even admirers , have often wondered how the most globalized country in the world – a continent inhabited by people from every land – can be so irrationally insular on some issues .
we scratch our heads about America ’ s gun laws .
we were astonished during President George W. Bush ’ s first term at the administration ’ s hostility to science , reflected in its stance on climate change and Charles Darwin ’ s theory of evolution .
the opposition to health-care reform is a similar cause of bemusement .
we know that despite its great wealth – and its groundbreaking medical research – America ’ s health-care system is awful .
it is hugely expensive .
its costs overwhelm workplace health-insurance schemes .
the poor go unprotected .
too many of the sick are untreated .
overall health statistics are worse than those in comparable countries .
yet Obama ’ s attempts to reform health care have run into hysterical opposition .
his proposals would lead , it is said , to the state murdering the elderly .
they would introduce Soviet communism into the US – just like what apparently exists in Canada and Britain , with their state-sponsored health systems .
communism in Toronto and London ?
or just better , cheaper , more reliable health care for all ?
reason seems to be having a hard time of it in the US just now .
Maybe it ’ s no coincidence that Groucho Marx was an American citizen .
but surely the way a society cares for its sick and needy and elderly is sufficiently important to deserve serious and thoughtful argument based on what we really can see with our own eyes rather than on uninformed partisan prejudice .
there are times when being proven right brings no pleasure .
for several years , I argued that America ’ s economy was being supported by a housing bubble that had replaced the stock market bubble of the 1990 ’ s .
but no bubble can expand forever .
with middle-class incomes in the United States stagnating , Americans could not afford ever more expensive homes .
as one of my predecessors as Chairman of the US President ’ s Council of Economic Advisers famously put it , “ that which is not sustainable will not be sustained . ” Economists , as opposed to those who make their living gambling on stocks , make no claim to being able to predict when the day of reckoning will come , much less identifying the event that will bring down the house of cards .
but the patterns are systematic , with consequences that unfold gradually , and painfully , over time .
there is a macro-story and a micro-story here .
the macro-story is simple , but dramatic .
some , observing the crash of the sub-prime mortgage market , say , “ Don ’ t worry , it is only a problem in the real estate sector . ” But this overlooks the key role that the housing sector has played in the US economy recently , with direct investment in real estate and money taken out of houses through refinancing mortgages accounting for two-thirds to three-quarters of growth over the last six years .
booming home prices gave Americans the confidence , and the financial wherewithal , to spend more than their income .
America ’ s household savings rate was at levels not seen since the Great Depression , either negative or zero .
with higher interest rates depressing housing prices , the game is over .
as America moves to , say , a 4 % savings rate ( still small by normal standards ) , aggregate demand will weaken , and with it , the economy .
the micro-story is more dramatic .
Record-low interest rates in 2001 , 2002 and 2003 did not lead Americans to invest more – there was already excess capacity .
instead , easy money stimulated the economy by inducing households to refinance their mortgages , and to spend some of their capital .
it is one thing to borrow to make an investment , which strengthens balance sheets ; it is another thing to borrow to finance a vacation or a consumption binge .
but this is what Alan Greenspan encouraged Americans to do .
when normal mortgages did not prime the pump enough , he encouraged them to take out variable-rate mortgages – at a time when interest rates had nowhere to go but up .
predatory lenders went further , offering negative amortization loans , so the amount owed went up year after year .
sometime in the future , payments would rise , but borrowers were told , again , not to worry : House prices would rise faster , making it easy to refinance with another negative amortization loan .
the only way ( in this view ) not to win was to sit on the sidelines .
all of this amounted to a human and economic disaster in the making .
now reality has hit : newspapers report cases of borrowers whose mortgage payments exceed their entire income .
globalization implies that America ’ s mortgage problem has worldwide repercussions .
the first run on a bank occurred against the British mortgage lender Northern Rock .
America managed to pass off bad mortgages worth hundreds of billions of dollars to investors ( including banks ) around the world .
they buried the bad mortgages in complicated instruments , buried them so deep that no one knew exactly how badly they were impaired , and no one could calculate how to re-price them quickly .
in the face of such uncertainty , markets froze .
those in financial markets who believe in free markets have temporarily abandoned their faith .
for the greater good of all ( of course , it is never for their own selfish interests ) , they argued a bailout was necessary .
while the US Treasury and the IMF warned East Asian countries facing financial crises ten years ago against the risks of bail-outs and told them not to raise their interest rates , the US ignored its own lectures about moral hazard effects , bought up billions in mortgages , and lowered interest rates .
but lower short-term interest rates have led to higher medium-term interest rates , which are more relevant for the mortgage market , perhaps because of increasing worries about inflationary pressures .
it may make sense for central banks ( or Fannie Mae , America ’ s major government-sponsored mortgage company ) to buy mortgage-backed securities in order to help provide market liquidity .
but those from whom they buy them should provide a guarantee , so the public does not have to pay the price for their bad investment decisions .
equity owners in banks should not get a free ride .
securitization , with all of its advantages in sharing risk , has three problems that were not adequately anticipated .
while it meant that American banks were not hit as hard as they would otherwise , America ’ s bad lending practices have had global effects .
Moreover , securitization contributed to bad lending : in the old days , banks that originated bad loans bore the consequences ; in the new world of securitization , the originators could pass the loans onto others .
( as economists would say , problems of asymmetric information have increased . )
in the old days , when borrowers found it impossible to make their payments , mortgages would be restructured ; foreclosures were bad for both the borrower and the lender .
securitization made debt restructuring difficult , if not impossible .
it is the victims of predatory lenders who need government help .
with mortgages amounting to 95 % or more of the value of the house , debt restructuring will not be easy .
what is required is to give individuals with excessive indebtedness an expedited way to a fresh start – for example , a special bankruptcy provision allowing them to recover , say , 75 % of the equity they originally put into the house , with the lenders bearing the cost .
there are many lessons for America , and the rest of the world ; but among them is the need for greater financial sector regulation , especially better protection against predatory lending , and more transparency .
a great puzzle in today ’ s world economy is the continued low level of long-term real interest rates in the United States .
conventional macroeconomists like me look at America ’ s current-account deficit , now running at 7 % of GDP , and know that such vast deficits are inevitably followed by large currency depreciations .
so we expect a substantial depreciation premium on US interest rates .
if the dollar falls 20 % more against the euro sometime in the next ten years , US long-term interest rates should be two percentage points higher than euro rates .
if it falls 40 % against the yen sometime in the next ten years , US long-term interest rates should be four percentage points higher than Japanese rates .
if it falls 60 % against China ’ s currency , the yuan , sometime in the next ten years , US long-term interest rates should be six percentage points higher than Chinese rates .
but we are not seeing signs of anything like this .
the puzzle is not only that long-term rates are too low when viewed in the international context , but also that they are too low when viewed in America ’ s domestic context .
the Bush administration continues to have no plans to sew up the veins it has opened with its medieval economic policy , which holds that bleeding revenue from the government cures all economic problems .
this means that unless America ’ s domestic savings rate rises mightily – which it shows no signs of doing – and unless investment expenditure remains abnormally low for the rest of this decade , the supply of loanable funds to finance investment will soon be much less than demand when the current-account deficit narrows to sustainable levels .
but when supply is less than demand , prices rise sharply .
in this case , the price of loanable funds is the real interest rate .
an expectation that interest rates will be high sometime in the next decade should mean high interest rates on long-term bonds today .
yet financial markets are not pricing dollar depreciation and a rise in long-term US interest rates accordingly .
when we macroeconomists talk to our friends on Wall Street , we find that they don ’ t view this as a puzzle at all .
on the contrary , they are puzzled about why we view the current low level of US long-term interest rates as worrisome .
from their perspective , today ’ s high demand for long-term dollar-denominated securities is easily explained : Asian central banks are buying in order to hold down their currencies , the US Treasury is borrowing short ( and thus not issuing that many long-term securities ) , and US companies are not undertaking the kinds of investments that would lead them to issue many long-term bonds .
but for every market mispricing there is a profit opportunity : if long-term interest rates are , indeed , too low and long-term bond prices too high , investors will short long-term US bonds , park the money elsewhere , wait for bond prices to return to fundamentals , and then cover their short positions .
by doing so , they will push prices close to fundamentals today .
Wall Streeters , however , offer a counterargument : for any financial institution to , say , bet on the decline of the dollar against the yuan over the next five years in a serious , leveraged way is to put its survival at risk should the trades go wrong .
and trades do go wrong : remember the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management .
the existence of large financial-market actors that do not care about maximizing their profits magnifies the riskiness of the bets .
if , say , the Bank of China and the Federal Reserve decided to teach speculators a lesson by pushing the dollar ’ s value relative to the yuan up by 20 % for a month , they could do so , bankrupting many financial institutions with short positions .
similarly , any financial institution that bets on a sharp rise in long-term interest rates over the next five years in a serious , leveraged way also puts its survival at risk .
for where should they park their money ?
real estate rental yields and stock-market payouts are low , and real estate and stock prices may well fall as much as or more than bond prices if interest rates spike .
only businesses that can borrow long-term now , lock in a low real interest rate , and invest in expanding their capacity can make the domestic bet that interest rates will rise .
but America ’ s businesses see enough risk in the future to be wary of getting stuck with unutilized capacity .
first , short-term interest rates were already so low that everyone would see further cuts as temporary only .
they would thus have little effect on the longer-term rates that really drive business investment .
second , short-term interest rates were so low that additional cuts would spook the financial markets : if even the Fed thought conditions warranted cuts , the argument went , businesses would respond not by increasing their investments but by reducing them .
the Fed &apos;s judgment appeared to be that it was largely ( if not completely ) powerless : it had done all that it could , and the levers of monetary policy were no longer strongly connected to determining the level of economic activity .
so the US in 2002 joined Japan in what economists have for sixty-five years called a Liquidity Trap : a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rates the central bank controls are so low and so loosely connected to the level of aggregate demand that further reductions are ineffective in fighting a recession .
America &apos;s situation was not unique : Japan had been in been in thrall to a liquidity trap since the mid-1990s .
but there had been no other examples since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
whether America now really is in a liquidity trap is uncertain .
how long this state of affairs will last is unknown .
nevertheless , even if America is only on the edge of a liquidity trap , and even if it moves away from the current state of affairs soon , this is a frightening situation .
if monetary policy is not effective , the only lever the American government has to manage its economy is fiscal policy : changes in the government &apos;s tax and spending plans to change the government &apos;s direct contribution to aggregate demand .
but the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government - with its complex , baroque , eighteenth-century organization - is incapable of changing policy fast enough to make effective use of fiscal policy as a tool for managing the economy .
it simply takes too long for changes in taxes and spending to work their way through Congress and the bureaucracy .
an America caught in a liquidity trap is , quite simply , a country with no effective tools of macroeconomic management .
there have been two eras since World War II when policymakers - American policymakers , at least - believed that they had solved the riddle of the business cycle and had learned how to manage a modern industrial or post-industrial economy .
the first was the Keynesian high-water mark of confidence in demand management of the 1960s .
it was destroyed by the inflation of the Vietnam era and the oil-price shocks of the 1970s .
the second was the decade of successful business-cycle management by Alan Greenspan &apos;s independent , apolitical , and technocratic Fed during the 1990s .
this second era now appears to have been as fleeting as the first .
Eighty years ago , John Maynard Keynes argued that governments needed to take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability - that the pre-World War I gold standard had not been the golden age people thought it was , and that its successes were the result of a lucky combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated .
Keynes was an optimist in believing that governments could learn to manage the business cycle .
he would be shocked to look at today &apos;s world : a Europe with stubbornly high unemployment , a Japan mired in a decade of near stagnation , and now an America lacking the policy tools to deal with any additional unexpected economic bad news .
MUNICH – Under substantial external pressure , the eurozone ’ s crisis-hit countries are , at long last , bringing themselves to make painful cuts in their government budgets .
salaries are being slashed and public employees sacked to reduce new borrowing to a tolerable level .
and yet , competitiveness in Greece and Portugal , in particular , is not improving .
the latest Eurostat figures on the evolution of the price index for self-produced goods ( GDP deflator ) show no tendency whatsoever in the crisis-stricken countries towards real devaluation .
but real devaluation , achieved by lowering prices vis-à-vis their eurozone competitors , is the only way to re-establish these countries ’ competitiveness .
a reduction in unit labor costs can also increase competitiveness only to the extent that it actually results in price reductions .
after all , it was price inflation in the crisis countries , fueled by massive inflows of cheap credit following the introduction of the euro , that resulted in their loss of competitiveness , ballooning current-account deficits , and accumulation of enormous foreign debt .
now that capital markets are no longer willing to finance these deficits , prices should be going into reverse , but this , obviously , is not happening .
in 2010 , inflation in some of the crisis countries lagged slightly behind that of their eurozone competitors .
the latest Eurostat figures for the third quarter of 2011 , however , are already showing a different picture : the price level in Portugal and Greece has remained practically unchanged over the course of the year , and in Italy and Spain it even rose slightly ( by 0.4 % and 0.3 % , respectively ) .
only Ireland continued on a path of rapid deflation – as it has since the country ’ s real-estate bubble burst in 2006 – with a relative price decrease of 2.2 % .
on the whole , Ireland has become cheaper relative to its eurozone competitors by a total of 15 % over the course of the past five years .
this internal devaluation is paying off : while Ireland was still running a current-account deficit of 5.6 % of GDP in 2008 , the European Commission expects the outturn for 2011 to have been a 0.7 % -of-GDP current-account surplus .
true , much of this is mere debt-service relief , given that Ireland was able to repay its foreign liabilities with self-printed money , for which it pays only 1 % interest .
however , Ireland ’ s big trade surplus did improve further .
Ireland owes much of this turnaround to its efficient export sector , whose supporters were able to enforce a political U-turn .
Greece , on the other hand , is under the influence of a strong import lobby .
as the Greek economics minister , Michalis Chrysochoidis , has said , this is attributable to European Union subsidies , which drove entrepreneurs to follow the easy money into the import sector .
now these importers form a powerful bulwark against any policy that causes deflation , even though lowering prices – and thereby redirecting Greek demand from foreign to domestic products and helping tourism – is the only way to put the Greek economy back on its feet .
since Greece ’ s current-account deficit as a share of GDP was three times higher than Ireland ’ s , Greek prices would have to fall by about half to achieve the same kind of success .
it is inconceivable that Greece could manage that within the eurozone without widespread social unrest , if not conditions approaching those of civil war .
but it isn ’ t just importers who are blocking real devaluation .
unions , too , are resisting the necessary wage reductions , and public and private debtors fear the prospect of insolvency if their assets and revenues are assessed at a lower value , while their debts remain unchanged .
the situation is intractable .
many people regard debt relief and socialization of debts as the only way out .
this help has been given .
the recent agreement gave Greece relief of € 237 billion ( $ 316 billion ) , about 30 % more than Greece ’ s net national income of roughly € 180 billion euros.But such help only entrenches the wrong prices – and thus the economy ’ s lack of competitiveness .
the debts will re-emerge like a tumor , growing year by year , while undermining the creditworthiness of stable eurozone countries .
if that happened , the euro would eventually collapse .
only a price reduction would create current-account surpluses and enable the crisis countries to pay off their foreign debts .
it is time for Europe to come to terms with this remorseless truth .
those crisis countries that do not want to take it upon themselves to lower their prices should be given the opportunity to leave the eurozone temporarily in order to devalue prices and debts .
in other words , they should take a kind of euro sabbatical – a proposal that has now also been taken up by American economist Kenneth Rogoff .
after the ensuing financial thunderstorm died down , the sun would come out again very quickly .
the creditor countries would have to shoulder big losses from write-downs , but they would still end up with more than they would have gotten had the crisis countries remained within the eurozone , because these countries ’ new prosperity , gained by leaving , offers the only chance of recovering any assets at all .
longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union ’ s future , but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration .
to join in the EU ’ s progress is the basic object of our foreign policy , for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end , but a beginning .
indeed , European unity is indivisible : when one nation is ostracized , all are not free .
we Europeans are caught in an inescapable net , tied in a single garment of destiny .
every aspect of our shared culture , if not the last century of shared suffering , confirms that for us .
whatever affects one European directly , affects all indirectly .
never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes , of haves and have-nots , of insiders and outsiders .
anyone who lives within the European continent cannot – indeed , must not – be considered a stranger to its Union .
today ’ s great Pax Europa and today ’ s pan-European prosperity depend on this .
of course , some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe .
let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people , young and old , factory worker , farmer ’ s wife , the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms .
are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance ?
are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930 ’ s , who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970 ’ s ?
are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland ’ s Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague ’ s Velvet Revolution in 1989 ?
that is the true European spirit , and no doubts can crush it .
to those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership , I say : let them , too , come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer .
let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English.Those who doubt Ukraine ’ s European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways ; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom , prosperity , and solidarity .
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe ’ s past is proud , and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region , but as a maker and shaper of Europe ’ s peace and Europe ’ s unity .
self-determination no longer means isolation , because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status .
new nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany – a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests .
that is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia , and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe ’ s peace .
of course , it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership .
we know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight .
we know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations , but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans .
building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy , cheap , or fast .
but , like the Union itself , it will be built and it will be done .
we know the challenge is great , but the prize is worth the struggle , and Europe should know that this is our goal .
part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism – ideologies born in the heart of Europe – battled for mastery .
only a few months ago , in cities throughout Ukraine , our children and our parents confronted armed troops , snarling dogs , and even death .
only a few years ago , a young journalist , Georgi Gongadze , seeking to inform the public about our old regime ’ s corruption , was brutalized and beheaded by that regime ’ s thugs .
but our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine ’ s people prevailed .
so , despite today ’ s doubts and difficulties , I retain an abiding faith in Europe .
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine ’ s history .
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism ’ s legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity .
when the EU ’ s citizens ponder Ukraine ’ s place in Europe , they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see .
they should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted , beyond the poverty , and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule .
instead , they should look closely at the face of our president , Viktor Yushchenko , ravaged by poison during last year ’ s election campaign , and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux , for whom “ the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded . ”
as the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Union &apos;s future institutions , now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading .
or at least , to consider perhaps a quite different question : where would it be reasonable for the EU to move ?
communism &apos;s fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe .
Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation .
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states .
Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia , Serbia , Macedonia ; it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well .
although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their pre-WWII independence , and Yugoslavia &apos;s breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence , there is something tantalizing new in all this as well .
in the interwar years , the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical , artificial creations of the Great Powers .
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states .
why was this ?
because 80 years ago , when Wilson , Clemenceau , and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe , small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace .
to be viable , a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market .
none of this holds true today .
with the prospect of entry into the EU , national markets matter less .
both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable , and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members .
lacking such external threats , the ties between , say , Czechs and Slovaks ( to say nothing of Serbs and Croats ! ) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government .
does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole ?
the difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years .
after all , wasn &apos;t Italy , until 1860s , a collection of kingdoms and principalities ?
wasn &apos;t Germany &apos;s unification a matter of ``blood and iron &apos; &apos; ?
France and Spain are older , but is the marriage of Basques , Catalans , and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former Czech / Slovak marriage ?
is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English ?
abstract for a second from the idea of French or German or Italian identity , patriotism , the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of today &apos;s linguistic communities and think of this : why do Europeans need an intermediate level of government , between the common European framework and their local institutions ?
why do Piemontese , Bavarians , or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies , welfare programs , securities laws , and the largely useless , duplicative armies ?
wouldn &apos;t life be easier if a common market , currency , foreign policy , army , and a few other things were run on a Europe-wide basis , with the rest left to more meaningful local units ?
it is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation .
but European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees , billions wasted in political patronage , and the colossal state machines that eat up 30-40 % of the economic product of Europe &apos;s nation states .
could any common European state do worse ?
indeed , the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy ( and society as a whole ) in Europe &apos;s entire history .
look at America in 1787 : creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies , ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent .
the simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states .
it is only as anadditional level of government that the EU appears onerous and bureaucratic .
if it were todisplace national governments , its burden would be weightless in comparison to what exists today .
nations also put Europe &apos;s constitutional balance out of kilter .
Germany and Italy are simply too big , as compared to Portugal or Belgium ( itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons ) , and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire .
could a federal Europe replace today &apos;s national identities ?
could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in ``Europe &apos; &apos; as they feel in their national states ?
no , but must they ?
when Europeans think of future institutions , the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity .
but what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions ?
what if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions , but by adevolution of loyalties , and a revival of smaller , more meaningful , communities ?
of course , the demise of national states is not imminent , but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens .
indeed , national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions , clichés , like race , class , and other ideological creations .
think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle .
but Europe &apos;s nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they arecenters of power .
after all , forty cents out of every euro of GDP is a lot to fight about .
if , however , Europeans gain a sense of where they should be going , perhaps in time the national identities forged in the last couple of hundred years ( for they are not much older than that ) will become like the appendix - a part of the human body responsible for little else but an occasional inflammation .
new HAVEN – The global economy is in the midst of its second growth scare in less than two years .
get used to it .
in a post-crisis world , these are the footprints of a failed recovery .
the reason is simple .
the typical business cycle has a natural cushioning mechanism that wards off unexpected blows .
the deeper the downturn , the more powerful the snapback , and the greater the cumulative forces of self-sustaining revival .
vigorous V-shaped rebounds have a built-in resilience that allows them to shrug off shocks relatively easily .
but a post-crisis recovery is a very different animal .
as Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in their book This Time is Different , over the long sweep of history , post-crisis recoveries in output and employment tend to be decidedly subpar .
such weak recoveries , by definition , lack the cushion of V-shaped rebounds .
consequently , external shocks quickly expose their vulnerability .
if the shocks are sharp enough – and if they hit a weakened global economy that is approaching its “ stall speed ” of around 3 % annual growth – the relapse could turn into the dreaded double-dip recession .
that is the risk today .
there can be no mistaking the decidedly subpar character of the current global recovery .
superficially , the numbers look strong : world GDP rebounded by 5.1 % in 2010 , and is expected to rise another 4.3 % in 2011 , according to the International Monetary Fund .
but because these gains follow the massive contraction that occurred during the Great Recession of 2008-2009 , they are a far cry from the trajectory of a classic V-shaped recovery .
indeed , if the IMF ’ s latest forecast proves correct , global GDP at the end of 2012 will still be about 2.2 percentage points below the level that would have been reached had the world remained on its longer-term 3.7 % annual-growth path .
even if the global economy holds at a 4.3 % cruise speed – a big “ if , ” in my view – it will remain below its trend-line potential for over eight years in a row , through 2015 .
this protracted “ global output gap ” underscores the absence of a cushion in today ’ s world economy , as well as its heightened sensitivity to shocks .
and there have certainly been numerous such blows in recent months – from Europe ’ s sovereign-debt crisis and Japan ’ s natural disasters to sharply higher oil prices and another setback in the US housing recovery .
while none of these shocks appears to have been severe enough to have derailed the current global recovery , the combined effect is worrisome , especially in a still-weakened post-crisis world .
most pundits dismiss the possibility of a double-dip recession .
Labeling the current slowdown a temporary “ soft patch , ” they pin their optimism on the inevitable rebound that follows any shock .
for example , a boost is expected from Japan ’ s reconstruction and supply-chain resumption .
another assist may come from America ’ s recent move to tap its strategic petroleum reserves in an effort to push oil prices lower .
but in the aftermath of the worst crisis and recession of modern times – when shocks can push an already weakened global economy to its tipping point a lot faster than would be the case under a stronger growth scenario – the escape velocity of self-sustaining recovery is much harder to achieve .
the soft patch may be closer to a quagmire .
this conclusion should not be lost on high-flying emerging-market economies , especially in Asia – currently the world ’ s fastest-growing region and the leader of what many now call a two-speed world .
yet with exports still close to a record 45 % of pan-regional GDP , Asia can hardly afford to take external shocks lightly – especially if they hit an already weakened baseline growth trajectory in the post-crisis developed world .
the recent slowdown in Chinese industrial activity underscores this very risk .
policymakers are ill prepared to cope with a steady stream of growth scares .
they continue to favor strategies that are better suited to combating crisis than to promoting post-crisis healing .
that is certainly true of the United States .
while the US Federal Reserve Board ’ s first round of quantitative easing was effective in ending a wrenching crisis , the second round has done little to sustain meaningful recovery in the labor market and the real economy .
America ’ s zombie consumers need to repair their damaged balance sheets , and US workers need to align new skills with new jobs .
open-ended liquidity injections accomplish neither .
European authorities are caught up in a similar mindset .
mistaking a solvency problem for a liquidity shortfall , Europe has become hooked on the drip feed of bailouts .
however , this works only if countries like Greece grow their way out of a debt trap or abrogate their deeply entrenched social contracts .
the odds on either are exceedingly poor .
the likelihood of recurring growth scares for the next several years implies little hope for new and creative approaches to post-crisis monetary and fiscal policies .
driven by short-term electoral horizons , policymakers repeatedly seek a quick fix – another bailout or one more liquidity injection .
yet , in the aftermath of a balance-sheet recession in the US , and in the midst of a debt trap in Europe , that approach is doomed to failure .
liquidity injections and bailouts serve only one purpose – to buy time . yet time is not the answer for economies desperately in need of the structural repairs of fiscal consolidation , private-sector deleveraging , labor-market reforms , or improved competitiveness .
nor does time cushion anemic post-crisis recoveries from the inevitable next shock .
it ’ s hard to know when the next shock will hit , or what form it will take ; otherwise , it wouldn ’ t be a shock .
but , as night follows day , such a disruption is inevitable .
with policymakers reluctant to focus on the imperatives of structural healing , the result will be yet another growth scare – or worse .
a failed recovery underscores the risks of an increasingly treacherous endgame in today ’ s post-crisis world .
Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission : open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month , or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway .
at the same time , the Commission ’ s latest report on Turkey ’ s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down , further calling into question the country ’ s future EU membership .
the Commission ’ s progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month .
at that meeting , European leaders should ask themselves the following questions : has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus ?
has the EU ’ s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey ?
what are the EU ’ s long-term interests vis-à-vis Turkey ?
if the answers to the first two questions are “ no ” – as I believe they are – the third question becomes vitally important .
true , Turkey has closed its ports to ships from ( Greek ) Cyprus , and this is a violation of agreements .
but it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership .
this is because Cyprus remains a divided island .
it was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004 .
a United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part .
but the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it .
nevertheless , Cyprus became an EU member – but only the Greek part .
this was clearly a mistake , because it made the EU part of the conflict .
it gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey .
so how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU ’ s fairness ?
political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching , for they have clearly been spurred by Turks ’ wish to move closer to the EU .
but Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal .
this has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction , towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state .
therefore , the recent lack of progress in Turkey ’ s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU ’ s behavior .
this leaves us with the third question : what kind of Turkey does the EU want ?
there should be no doubt about the answer : it is clearly in the EU ’ s interest to see Turkey ’ s democracy and economy continue to strengthen .
more than 40 years ago , it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership , it will be welcome in the EU .
it is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously .
it is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership .
but they are reacting to the current situation .
when they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner – a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria ( democracy , rule of law , respect for human rights , and an effective market economy ) – many more are inclined to say yes .
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges .
first , they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey , and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans .
second , they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations .
the first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors .
here the Finns , who chair the EU right now , have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict .
the Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders .
at the same time , a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN ’ s proposals regarding Cyprus .
if this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU ’ s own ranks , so be it .
the agreement on climate change reached at Heiligendamm by the G8 leaders merely sets the stage for the real debate to come : how will we divide up the diminishing capacity of the atmosphere to absorb our greenhouse gases ?
the G8 leaders agreed to seek “ substantial ” cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and to give “ serious consideration ” to the goal of halving such emissions by 2050 – an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
yet the agreement commits no one to any specific targets , least of all the United States , whose president , George W. Bush , will no longer be in office in 2009 , when the tough decisions have to be made .
one could reasonably ask why anyone thinks such a vague agreement is any kind of advance at all .
at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , 189 countries , including the US , China , India , and all the European nations , signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , thereby agreeing to stabilize greenhouse gases “ at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . ”
fifteen years later , no country has done that .
US per capita greenhouse gas emissions , already the highest of any major nation when Bush took office , have continued to rise .
in March , a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions were expected to rise almost as fast over the next decade as they did during the previous decade .
now we have yet another agreement to do what these same nations said they would do 15 years ago .
that ’ s a triumph ?
if Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails , that will be easy enough .
in justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol , Bush has always referred to the fact that it did not commit China and India to mandatory emission limits .
now , in response to suggestions by Bush and other G8 leaders that the larger developing nations must be part of the solution to climate change , Ma Kai , the head of China ’ s National Development and Reform Commission , has said that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets .
likewise , the spokesman of India ’ s foreign minister , Navtej Sarna , has said that his country would reject such mandatory restrictions .
are China and India being unreasonable ?
their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases emitted by the industrialized nations over the past century .
that is true : most of those gases are still in the atmosphere , and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it now is .
China and India claim the right to proceed with industrialization and development as the developed nations did , unhampered by limits on their greenhouse gas emissions .
China , India , and other developing nations , have a point – or rather , three points .
first , if we apply the principle “ You broke it , you fix it , ” then the developed nations have to take responsibility for our “ broken ” atmosphere , which can no longer absorb more greenhouse gases without the world ’ s climate changing .
second , even if we wipe the slate clean and forget about who caused the problem , it remains true that the typical US resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical Chinese , and as much as 18 times more than the average Indian .
third , the richer nations are better able than less well-off nations to absorb the costs of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations .
but it is also true that if China and India continue to increase their output of greenhouse gases , they will eventually undo all the good that would be achieved by deep emissions cuts in the industrialized nations .
this year or next , China will overtake the US as the world ’ s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – on a national , rather than a per capita basis , of course .
in 25 years , according to Fatih Birol , chief economist at the International Energy Agency , China ’ s emissions could be double those of the US , Europe , and Japan combined .
but there is a solution that is both fair and practical :
establish the total amount of greenhouse gases that we can allow to be emitted without causing the earth ’ s average temperature to rise more than two degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) , the point beyond which climate change could become extremely dangerous .
divide that total by the world ’ s population , thus calculating what each person ’ s share of the total is .
allocate to each country a greenhouse gas emissions quota equal to the country ’ s population , multiplied by the per person share .
finally , allow countries that need a higher quota to buy it from those that emit less than their quota .
the fairness of giving every person on earth an equal share of the atmosphere ’ s capacity to absorb our greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to deny .
why should anyone have a greater entitlement than others to use the earth ’ s atmosphere ?
but , in addition to being fair , this scheme also has practical benefits .
it would give developing nations a strong incentive to accept mandatory quotas , because if they can keep their per capita emissions low , they will have excess emissions rights to sell to the industrialized nations .
the rich countries will benefit , too , because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of reducing emissions and buying up emissions rights from developing nations .
in recent days , Italy ’ s government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country ’ s troop deployment in Afghanistan , while Britain and Denmark announced that they are to begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq .
whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq , and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan , America ’ s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy .
they are increasingly convinced that “ victory ” will be elusive in any asymmetric conflict between states , however powerful , and religiously driven armed insurgents .
Donald Rumsfeld ’ s dogma of military “ transformation ” – the technological upgrading of an army ’ s capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops – failed resoundingly in Iraq .
nor could Israel , with its overwhelming technological advantage , defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon .
more rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II .
so the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon : an asymmetric entity , Hezbollah , with nation-state firepower .
so the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point .
neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980 ’ s nor NATO ’ s today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield .
when geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent , as in Kosovo , Afghanistan , and Iraq , mass no longer equals victory .
the great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz ’ s notion of “ decisive battles ” as the “ center of gravity ” of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible “ center of gravity . ”
indeed , while wars from the time of Hannibal ’ s defeat of the Romans in 216 B.C. to the Gulf War of 1991 had this center of gravity , with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees , such industrial inter-state wars have now become an historical anachronism .
most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate , and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war .
in fact , the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble .
Moreover , in an era of global media and international war crimes courts , the criteria for states ’ use of military force have become more complex than ever .
inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found , such as Israel ’ s border with Syria , India ’ s border with Pakistan , and the border dividing the two Koreas .
in such cases , war , as the Egyptians showed in 1973 , might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict .
the Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights .
however , in the case of Kashmir , the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into all-out war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence.Indeed , such asymmetric conflicts through proxies have become the new conventional way that states avoid the price of a general war .
this changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete .
the facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing . “ Victory ” cannot bring peace , simply because there will always be a war after the war .
thus , for example , the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months , only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict .
likewise , America ’ s three-week “ shock and awe ” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “ victory , ” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike .
and six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon , Hezbollah is as strong as it was before .
nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched .
it is during the war after the war that the occupier ’ s inferiority is revealed , with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield .
the insurgents in Iraq , as the British admit , were able in just three years to cope with their enemies ’ technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in 30 years .
the Iraq war and Israel ’ s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve , as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution .
when it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts , forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity .
that said , it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary .
but the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today ’ s asymmetric conflicts , victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield .
only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results .
Moscow – Twenty-five years ago this month , I sat across from Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik , Iceland to negotiate a deal that would have reduced , and could have ultimately eliminated by 2000 , the fearsome arsenals of nuclear weapons held by the United States and the Soviet Union .
for all our differences , Reagan and I shared the strong conviction that civilized countries should not make such barbaric weapons the linchpin of their security .
even though we failed to achieve our highest aspirations in Reykjavik , the summit was nonetheless , in the words of my former counterpart , “ a major turning point in the quest for a safer and secure world . ”
the next few years may well determine if our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever be realized .
critics present nuclear disarmament as unrealistic at best , and a risky utopian dream at worst .
they point to the Cold War ’ s “ long peace ” as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only means of staving off a major war .
as someone who has commanded these weapons , I strongly disagree .
nuclear deterrence has always been a hard and brittle guarantor of peace .
by failing to propose a compelling plan for nuclear disarmament , the US , Russia , and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting through inaction a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used .
that catastrophe must be forestalled .


as I , along with George P. Shultz , William J. Perry , Henry A. Kissinger , Sam Nunn , and others , pointed out five years ago , nuclear deterrence becomes less reliable and more risky as the number of nuclear-armed states increases .
barring preemptive war ( which has proven counterproductive ) or effective sanctions ( which have thus far proven insufficient ) , only sincere steps toward nuclear disarmament can furnish the mutual security needed to forge tough compromises on arms control and nonproliferation matters .
the trust and understanding built at Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties .
the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty destroyed the feared quick-strike missiles then threatening Europe ’ s peace .
and , in 1991 , the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START I ) cut the bloated US and Soviet nuclear arsenals by 80 % over a decade .
but prospects for progress on arms control and nonproliferation are darkening in the absence of a credible push for nuclear disarmament .
I learned during those two long days in Reykjavik that disarmament talks could be as constructive as they are arduous .
by linking an array of interrelated matters , Reagan and I built the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nuclear-arms race of which we had lost control .
in retrospect , the Cold War ’ s end heralded the coming of a messier arrangement of global power and persuasion .
the nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume “ good faith ” negotiations for disarmament .
this would augment the diplomatic and moral capital available to diplomats as they strive to restrain nuclear proliferation in a world where more countries than ever have the wherewithal to construct a nuclear bomb .
only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the reassurance and the credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine .
we can no longer afford , politically or financially , the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear “ haves ” and “ have-nots . ”
Reykjavik proved that boldness is rewarded .
conditions were far from favorable for a disarmament deal in 1986 .
before I became Soviet leader in 1985 , relations between the Cold War superpowers had hit rock bottom .
Reagan and I were nonetheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant outreach and face-to-face interaction .
what seem to be lacking today are leaders with the boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order .
economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster helped spur us to action .
why has the Great Recession and the disastrous meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan not elicited a similar response today ?
a first step would be for the US finally to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) .
President Barack Obama has endorsed this treaty as a vital instrument to discourage proliferation and avert nuclear war .
it ’ s time for Obama to make good on commitments he made in Prague in 2009 , take up Reagan ’ s mantle as Great Communicator , and persuade the US Senate to formalize America ’ s adherence to the CTBT .
this would compel the remaining holdouts – China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Iran , Israel , North Korea , and Pakistan – to reconsider the CTBT as well .
that would bring us closer to a global ban on nuclear tests in any environment – the atmosphere , undersea , in outer space , or underground .
a second necessary step is for the US and Russia to follow up on the New START agreement and begin deeper weapons cuts , especially tactical and reserve weapons , which serve no purpose , waste funds , and threaten security .
this step must be related to limits on missile defense , one of the key issues that undermined the Reykjavik summit .
a fissile material cut-off treaty ( FMCT ) , long stalled in multilateral talks in Geneva , and a successful second Nuclear Security Summit next year in Seoul , will help secure dangerous nuclear materials .
this will also require that the 2002 Global Partnership , dedicated to securing and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction – nuclear , chemical , and biological – is renewed and expanded when it convenes next year in the US .
our world remains too militarized .
in today ’ s economic climate , nuclear weapons have become loathsome money pits .
if , as seems likely , economic troubles continue , the US , Russia , and other nuclear powers should seize the moment to launch multilateral arms reductions through new or existing channels such as the UN Conference on Disarmament .
these deliberations would yield greater security for less money .
but the buildup of conventional military forces – driven in large part by the enormous military might deployed globally by the US – must be addressed as well .
as we engage in furthering our Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) agreement , we should seriously consider reducing the burden of military budgets and forces globally .
US President John F. Kennedy once warned that “ every man , woman , and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles , hanging by the slenderest of threads , capable of being cut at any moment . ”
for more than 50 years , humanity has warily eyed that lethal pendulum while statesmen debated how to mend its fraying cords .
the example of Reykjavik should remind us that palliative measures are not enough .
our efforts 25 years ago can be vindicated only when the Bomb ends up beside the slave trader ’ s manacles and the Great War ’ s mustard gas in the museum of bygone savagery .
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip , as well as some settlements in the West Bank , has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world .
many denounced Sharon &apos;s plan as a trick .
but that surprise was wrong-headed from the start .
despite the way it often looks to outsiders , debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves .
like everything in Israel , the process is more complicated , especially where the hawks are concerned .
basically , there are two species of Israeli hawks : call one kind ideological and the other strategic .
ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel , the homeland of the Jewish people .
for them , the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony , which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria .
not all ideological hawks are religious , although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies .
but many ideological hawks are secular nationalists , and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists .
former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category .
ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud .
they are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky , who founded &quot; Revisionist &quot; Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel &apos;s Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion .
then there are the strategic hawks .
for them , given Israel &apos;s narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity , controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative , but is driven by security considerations .
for them , Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands , but security outposts , aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland .
they may be right or wrong in this assessment , but it is not an ideological one .
Ariel Sharon , who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky &apos;s ideas - is a strategic hawk .
for ideological hawks , compromises are treason : how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people , let alone God &apos;s promise to Abraham ?
strategic hawks , however , are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes .
it is in this context that Sharon &apos;s moves should be seen .
he was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security .
he has brought neither .
with the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein , the danger of an &quot; Eastern front &quot; against Israel has diminished .
absent a Palestinian partner , and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel &apos;s harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking : set up an effective barrier , move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements , and wait for another day .
if one follows Sharon &apos;s statements in the last year , a clear pattern emerges .
first , he admitted that &quot; eventually &quot; a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks .
a few months later , he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of &quot; liberated &quot; rather than &quot; occupied &quot; territories .
last December , he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement , and that this would entail the &quot; relocation &quot; of some settlements .
although this was still merely verbiage , it was novel language for a Likud prime minister .
Sharon &apos;s latest statements , though , explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated ; the Director of the National Security Council , General Giora Eiland , was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations , including compensation for relocated settlers .
all of this has radically altered Israel &apos;s domestic political map .
some ideological hawks in Sharon &apos;s government threatened to resign ; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net ; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government .
the test , of course , is not in the planning , but in the implementation of withdrawal , and the road is long and bumpy .
Sharon &apos;s timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption .
yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon &apos;s future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir , Sharon comes from the military , and for him security - not ideology - is supreme .
so his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise .
with the final stage of the World Cup approaching , now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal .
this year ’ s Cup , unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002 , didn ’ t witness any real upsets in the first round .
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round , and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat , with only Ghana advancing .
there have been just two ugly matches so far , full of fouls , nasty attacks , and unnecessary aggression , as well as numerous yellow and red cards : Italy vs. the US , and Portugal vs. the Netherlands .
otherwise , we ’ re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany , in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere .
as for Germany and the Germans , one hardly recognizes one ’ s own country and people .
even Mother Nature has played along .
after a long winter and a non-existent spring , summer started promptly with the first kick-off – and virtually overnight , Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side .
the weather is Mediterranean , and all of a sudden , so are the people .
the Cup ’ s organization has been exceptional ( as was to be expected ) , with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance .
the whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world ( which was not expected ) .
and the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer ( which nobody could have expected ! ) .
more importantly , not only in the German team , but also in the country as a whole , a young , cool , laid-back , and carefree Germany is raising its head – a Germany that is cosmopolitan , friendly , and good-humored .
years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace .
doctors are on strike , taxes are on the rise , the parties in government are mauling each other , and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape .
but the Germans , undaunted by it all , simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world .
the black , red , and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before , but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones .
in fact , the flags of many nations fly alongside German .
in Berlin , as in other large German cities , taxis sport the flags of their drivers ’ home countries – from Angola to Saudi Arabia .
fans don not just their nations ’ flags , but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries ’ colors .
flags are flown in hope of victory , but also serve to dry the tears of defeat .
in short , Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night ’ s dream , with a touch of Woodstock to boot .
outside the stadiums , public screenings of the games have become joyous mass “ happenings . ”
and how is the soccer ?
this World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone .
first , Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer .
so we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity .
second , international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation .
Spain , Argentina , and Germany , to name but a few countries , have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game .
on the French , English , and Portuguese teams , too , it is the young players that have shone – despite the continuing presence of Zidane , Beckham , and Figo .
even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002 .
this generational change is accelerated by a third development .
at the top international level , soccer has become faster and more athletic , and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively .
a team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 ( or more ) minutes , switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team , and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents &apos; movements won ’ t stand much of a chance .
here , soccer parallels today ’ s globalized markets , which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary .
unlike economic globalization , however , it remains to be seen whether this new , fast-paced style of soccer will prevail ( after all , the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France ) .
the sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does .
for now , we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new , young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted , enthralling , and beautiful to watch .
let ’ s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9 , we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible .
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism , because , unfortunately , two universal principles will continue to apply in the future : first , the winter will return , and , second , the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult .
watching the news from Iraq , I recall when I was Poland &apos;s Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991 .
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad .
hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq . ``Yes , I know , &apos; &apos; I said . ``I &apos;ve been watching the bombardment on TV . &apos; &apos;
Twelve years later , Poland &apos;s Prime Minister didn &apos;t need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq .
all the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US , now Poland &apos;s NATO ally .
indeed , Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq &apos;s occupation .
what a distance Poland has travelled since communism &apos;s collapse in 1989 !
little of this , however , is the result of design , for ( unfortunately ) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union .
we remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us .
couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by ``simply existing &apos; &apos; we influence Europe &apos;s fate ; others suffer crippling pessimism , consigning Poland to permanent ``second-class &apos; &apos; status--and you have a recipe for inertia .
our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out .
much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset : we say that we want a common foreign and security policy , but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges .
then we squabble about what to do .
the time for such laxity is over .
for Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO , membership in the Alliance didn &apos;t really require debate .
our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was theonlyreal option .
EU membership and the global war on terror , however , demand a more deeply considered response .
why ?
because EU membership affects every aspect of a state , economy , and society , while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy .
today &apos;s crisis in transatlantic relations , and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s ``New Europe , &apos; &apos; means that Poland ( like every other European state ) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO .
we must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests , as well what it really means to be an EU partner .
only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the ``new &apos; &apos; and ``old &apos; &apos; Europe , as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds .
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder .
instead , the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today &apos;s emerging European order .
they see new players ( say , Spain ) rising to shape EU policy , particularly foreign policy , and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged .
but an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades .
so the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American ``Trojan Horse . &apos; &apos;
instead , the EU &apos;s structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe &apos;s role in the world , but also new means to achieve consensus .
history cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power .
the world needs a united continent , ready to go into action .
that consensus must include the US .
during the Cold War , most Europeans tolerated America &apos;s tendency to lead unilaterally , because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power .
but America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era .
its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic , and its belief that Europe &apos;s ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won &apos;t spend the money necessary to achieve that goal .
here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus .
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective .
intentions don &apos;t deter invasions .
as Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said , ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country &apos;s security .
the US is , but security does not come free of charge . &apos; &apos;
most Poles think that Poland &apos;s situation is akin to Denmark &apos;s .
indeed , all of Europe is in thrall to American power .
but this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America .
if the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth , many of today &apos;s divisions will disappear .
the EU &apos;s foreign policy should be guided by the following goals :
fight terrorism ;
prevent local conflict ;
promote human rights and democracy ;
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible ;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US ;
help poor countries .
Polish foreign policy , like that of the EU , can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives .
they are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations , in an expanded Union , and in relations between the ``New &apos; &apos; and ``Old &apos; &apos; Europe .
BERKELEY – Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year : governments , he said , are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure .
Summers was criticizing Europe ’ s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances – between the EU ’ s north and south , and between reckless banks ’ creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly – worsen with each passing day .
but , on the other side of the Atlantic , Americans have no reason to feel smug .
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States , where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America ’ s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis .
the US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rate of 1 % per year .
suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $ 500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even unproductively , on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25 % per year .
suppose that – as seems to be the case – the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two .
in that case , the $ 500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $ 1 trillion of extra output of goods and services , generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment , and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years .
and , with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs , the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future .
the impressive gains don ’ t stop there .
better infrastructure would mean an extra $ 20 billion a year of income and social welfare .
a lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $ 20 billion a year in higher production .
and half of the extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households .
in sum , on the benefits side of the equation : more jobs now , $ 500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years , and then a $ 40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter .
so , what are the likely costs of an extra $ 500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years ?
for starters , the $ 500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $ 300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity .
so the net result would be a $ 200 billion increase in the national debt .
American taxpayers would then have to pay $ 2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years , and then pay off or roll over the entire $ 200 billion .
the $ 40 billion a year of higher economic activity would , however , generate roughly $ 10 billion a year in additional tax revenue .
using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due , the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt .
in other words , taxpayers win , because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt , enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates .
households win , too , because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes .
companies win , because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure .
the unemployed win , because some of them get jobs .
and even bond investors win , because they get their money back , with the interest for which they contracted .
so what is not to like ?
nothing .
how , you might ask , can I say this ?
I am an economist – a professor of the Dismal Science , in which there are no free lunches , in which benefits are always balanced by costs , and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are .
but there are two things different about today .
first , the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole .
second , bond investors are being really stupid .
in a world in which the S &amp; amp ; P 500 has a 7 % annual earnings yield , nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1 % per year .
that six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors ’ extraordinary and irrational panic .
they are willing to pay 6 % per year for “ safety . ”
right now , however , the US government can manufacture “ safety ” out of thin air merely by printing bonds .
the government , too , would then win by pocketing that 6 % per year of value – though 30 years from now , bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios ’ extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy .
new YORK – The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum – and France is leading the effort .
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum , gas , and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges .
France , at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G-8 and G-20 this year , is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move .
with French leadership , 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear , precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractive-industry companies to governmental authorities .
oil , gas , and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies .
Moreover , these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries .
yet , despite great natural wealth , a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty .
the actual taxes and payments made by mining , oil , and other extractive-industry companies to governments are usually a well-kept secret , even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good .
in reality , in far too many countries , ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money ; in fact , they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations .
indeed , these well-kept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions .
witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East .
in these countries , many of which are rich in oil and gas , citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression .
at bottom , they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries ’ wealth and resources – with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world ’ s energy supplies .
transparency is an essential part of the solution .
citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms , as well as mining companies , publish all of their relevant financial information , broken down by country and by project , and including all payments made to host-country public budgets .
if European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractive-industry companies listed on their stock exchanges , this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located .
regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular , timely basis , and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies .
the United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments , through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law .
that law ’ s requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to 90 % of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies .
this will help citizens track how that money is used , but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share .
if the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers , financial and accounting balances , and payments to authorities , companies would become truly accountable to citizens , and government revenues would be augmented .
such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission , and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency .
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting “ initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance , integrity , and transparency in economic transactions . ”
at its just-completed summit in Deauville , France , the G-8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil , gas , and mining companies .
this is an important advance , but , unfortunately , it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative , and it focuses only on payments transparency .
now the world must look to the G-20 summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed , given that important emerging economies such as Brazil , India , and China , as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries , will be at the table .
the importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era – and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone .
greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives , economies , and political systems around the world .
the late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that “ a week is a long time in politics . ”
so , in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election , any prediction made today could be reversed , and reversed again , before the vote .
but two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls : Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left .
in fact , they have more in common than meets the eye , for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity .
for Sarkozy , “ rupture ” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices .
the 12 years of Jacques Chirac ‘ s presidency , together with France ’ s tradition of alternation in power , suggests a victory for the left .
positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today ’ s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate .
this is reflected in Sarkozy ’ s openly pro-American stance – an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high .
Sarkozy ’ s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America ’ s military adventure in Iraq , but that their style was disastrously wrong .
thus , his deep admiration for “ American values , ” while sincere , implies no embrace of President George W. Bush .
it also reassures the French business community , which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin ’ s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac ’ s foreign minister .
at home , Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young , issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline , a counter-revolutionary revolution .
the revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968 , whose leaders and supporters , according to Sarkozy , may have lost politically to de Gaulle , but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on “ false values . ”
by contrast , rebelling against one ’ s parents ’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues , such as education and immigration , that may dominate the electoral campaign .
in the case of Royal , the meaning of “ rupture ” is both more obvious and more visible .
she is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic .
to achieve her goal , she prefers to emphasize her “ essence , ” thereby countering Sarkozy ’ s stress on his record as a “ doer . ”
her appeal to voters is simple : “ I am a woman , and you have never tried a woman , so be modern and try one now . ”
Hiding behind the originality ( in French presidential politics ) of her gender , Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program .
when challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda , her highly effective line of defense ( so far ! ) has been : “ You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman ! ”
thus , Royal ’ s program is her popularity .
in foreign policy , one can only guess what her priorities would be .
as far as Europe is concerned , she seems as “ agnostic ” as Sarkozy , who , like her , incarnates a new generation of “ post-European ” leaders .
in terms of values , Royal , too , seems to represent a rupture with May 1968 , with her emphasis on discipline and family .
according to public opinion polls , Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy .
her support is particularly strong among women voters .
for the Socialist Party , which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002 , the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal .
in the opinion of Royal ’ s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants , the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity : the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern .
according to Royal ’ s Socialist critics , the “ Hollywoodization ” of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead .
but the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy .
Moreover , both candidates embody continuity – with Chirac ’ s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal – as much as rupture .
Royal openly claims Mitterand ’ s legacy as she searches for legitimacy , while Sarkozy ’ s rejection of Chirac ’ s legacy has more to do with form than substance .
to a large extent , Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more , whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less .
when the voters decide in the spring of 2007 , their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations , as it did in 2002 , when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round .
as in 2002 , the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less .
but one way or the other , personalities will prevail over programs .
as Europe ’ s leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the new , slimmed down , Reform Treaty , it might be helpful if they all pretended that the last 50 years of European integration had never taken place .
let ’ s then imagine what Europe needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges , especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU deal-making and ramshackle institution-building .
on top of that , let us make a major leap of imagination and suppose that even though this scenario of the EU at “ Year Zero ” means we would not have a half-century of intra-European cooperation to draw on , the nations that today make up the EU would nevertheless be keen to adopt far-reaching joint policies .
let ’ s suspend our disbelief , then , and try to imagine what Europe could and should be doing to tackle some of the most far-reaching and obstinate policy challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years are as constructive as the last .
or , to put it another way , let ’ s look at our problems in the light of the EU ’ s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies , and then let ’ s ask ourselves why the EU isn ’ t realizing its own potential and delivering the goods .
broadly , we see three areas in which Europe ’ s policymakers at both the national and EU levels can do better : global challenges where Europe could show greater leadership , the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and worldwide , and improvement in the effectiveness of the EU ’ s own political machinery .
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda .
it needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tougher EU goals , and then use its international economic and trade clout to champion new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful .
on conflict and security issues , Europe should be advancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma ’ s military regime .
the purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fair-minded player on the world stage , rather than as a “ broad church ” in which different viewpoints co-exist .
the aim should be that “ soft power ” instruments like EU development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security outreach to ensure Europe is a global player to be reckoned with .
that means , of course , that the EU should seek to widen its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States cooperate more closely on defining – and thus protecting – their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than 10 % of the total population .
these points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU ’ s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy .
but they are intended to underline what many people in Europe know very well , which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily outpaces the EU ’ s policy responses so far .
building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities .
education is by far the most profitable investment Europe can make , so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the EU while helping to expand greatly education in the world ’ s poorest countries .
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy – something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders .
agreed EU-wide immigration rules are needed to reconcile shrinking Europe ’ s hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest .
it won ’ t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe , but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price .
by much the same token , Europe ’ s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans ’ sense of a shared history and common values .
a stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multi-cultural society that demographers regard as inevitable .
meanwhile , doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals .
Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders ’ mid-year agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union ’ s decision-making mechanisms , but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries .
we believe , though , that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself .
that way , if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty , it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor , the Constitutional Treaty , was in 2005 .
coral reefs are the world &apos;s most biologically rich marine ecosystems , harboring some of the world &apos;s most beautiful organisms .
they provide the principal source of protein for over ten million people worldwide .
Reef-based activities ( principally fishing and tourism ) form the economic livelihood of millions more .
clearly , the human costs of a worldwide breakdown of these ecosystems are enormous .
yet global deterioration of coral reefs is severe and ongoing .
wholesale disintegration of reef ecosystems has occurred in some places , and collapse on a worldwide scale is a real risk .
but there is some good news , too : we know what steps the international community can take now to protect and restore reefs &apos; ``resilience &apos; &apos; -- their capacity to maintain integrity in the face of the environmental fluctuations that are a natural part of life in any ecosystem .
we must mediate the severity of global warming , while simultaneously conserving the resilience of coral reefs .
historically , the principal agents of reef degradation have been over-fishing and pollution , not global warming .
in healthy ecosystems , when prey numbers decline , predators become malnourished , and their numbers decline , too , giving their prey a chance to recover .
but human predators are different .
when our prey numbers decline , their economic value tends to increase , so fishing intensifies .
this means that once predator species become depleted , fishing pressure shifts towards plant-eating fish species , leading to precipitous declines in the numbers of herbivores on coral reefs .
Herbivorous fish are key players on coral reefs .
when coral populations decline in the aftermath of cyclones , diseases , and other disturbances , it is the herbivores that keep seaweed in check , and allow coral populations to recover .
without them , fast-growing seaweed quickly monopolizes space on the reef , preventing restoration of healthy quantities of coral cover .
because corals provide the habitat structure on which other reef organisms depend , the decreases in coral cover lead to big decreases in a reef &apos;s biodiversity .
pollution by nutrients and toxins from adjacent land areas further vitiate coral populations &apos; ability to recover , giving seaweed an even greater competitive edge .
corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a one-celled plant .
the animal provides shelter and nutrients for the plant ; the plant converts sunlight into energy , which it shares with the animal .
for reasons that are not yet fully understood , this partnership breaks down when corals experience unusually high temperatures .
the plant is expelled , and corals turn a brilliant white color .
if temperatures soon return to normal , the partnership can be restored .
but if corals remain ``bleached &apos; &apos; for too long , they die .
for many species of coral , this bleaching threshold is usually only a couple of degrees centigrade above the typical maximum temperature for a given location .
interpreted in light of even the most optimistic global warming scenarios , this is disturbing news .
if coral bleaching thresholds remain steady , local summer temperatures will exceed those thresholds regularly within a few decades .
corals grow slowly , so reefs sustaining severe bleaching will not recover before they bleach again .
Fortunately , there is evidence that bleaching thresholds evolve .
most coral species have broad geographical distributions , and bleach at different temperatures depending on location .
many species that bleach at 28o or 29o centigrade on Australia &apos;s Great Barrier Reef routinely tolerate temperatures of 34o or more in the Arabian Sea .
unfortunately , we do not know how long it takes for such adaptation to occur .
two things can be done to protect coral reefs .
the first is obvious : minimize global warming by , say , honoring the Kyoto Treaty &apos;s emissions targets .
second , we must restore coral reefs &apos; capacity to cope with environmental change--their resilience--by protecting the fish stocks that keep seaweed in check , and thereby facilitate the recovery of coral populations from bleaching .
these recovery phases enable adaptations to higher temperatures to spread .
without fish , seaweed dominance will prevent that recovery .
the catastrophic collapse of fish stocks around the world--on coral reefs and elsewhere--has provided hard lessons about managing fisheries .
many intensively regulated fisheries have collapsed along with the unregulated ones .
so there is a growing consensus that standard techniques for managing fisheries must be complemented with a system of ``no-take zones &apos; &apos; --areas in which fishing is prohibited altogether .
as fish populations in these no-take zones recover , they create ``spill-over &apos; &apos; effects , with catches often increasing in areas outside the no-take zones .
more importantly , they provide a refuge for fish populations , a kind of insurance policy against stock collapse .
on coral reefs , these no-take zones can help insure that a portion of coral reef habitat sustains a healthy fish community , and secure the coral reef resilience that this brings .
scientific evidence indicates that , to be effective , 30-50 % of available habitat should be set aside as no-take zones .
this figure is far higher than levels of protection in even the wealthiest countries that harbor significant coral reefs , the US and Australia , where current levels of protection are less than 5 % .
given the magnitude of the threat to the world &apos;s coral reefs , the international community &apos;s response has been frighteningly slow .
but there is some encouraging news : in June , Australia &apos;s government proposed a major increase in no-take areas within the Great Barrier Reef to over 30 % .
if adopted , this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps prompt other nations to follow suit .
the future of tropical marine ecosystems , and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them , depend on it .
Gaza – This was supposed to be my first year of medical school .
instead , I am stuck here in Gaza , in my father ’ s house inside the Jabalia refugee camp , with few options and no way out .
after I finished high school last year , I decided to become a doctor .
Gaza cries out for bone specialists , but the training I need is available only abroad .
when I won a place at a medical college in Germany , my parents were proud .
I was excited to follow my older brother , who is already studying there .
in February , the German authorities granted me an entrance visa .
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe .
but I was told that only patients in need of emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out – not students .
hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad .
for many of us , this is our only opportunity to continue our education .
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth , and one of the poorest – 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide .
the local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures , like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery .
universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies .
many subjects are not even taught , and there are few post-graduate programs .
instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza .
without the ability to go overseas , we cannot learn .
in June , after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip , the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with “ recognized ” scholarships – but not “ hundreds . ”
so hundreds of us are still waiting , most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world ’ s attention .
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave .
life in Gaza has bled away my optimism .
my father is a teacher and owns a children ’ s clothing shop .
my mother is a housekeeper .
I have six brothers and three sisters .
we returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia , where my father had been working as a teacher .
that was at the height of the peace process .
my parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in 1993 , and decided that they could give us a better life here .
but when I was ten , the secondintifada began .
the peace process was collapsing throughout my teenage years .
during my third year of high school , the Israeli authorities closed off the Gaza Strip .
Israeli border controls have reduced the flow of people crossing the border to a trickle , and have suffocated Gaza ’ s economy , choking off imports and exports and cutting fuel deliveries and electricity .
there is no clothing left in my father ’ s shop , which was supposed to support my brother and me during our studies .
with the backing of the US , Canada , and the European Union , Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas , which won the elections here in 2006 .
but the blockade only makes people more desperate .
Hamas and other armed groups , I know , have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages .
but I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip , including Jabalia .
Israel ’ s blockade amounts to collective punishment .
it is hurting all of us , whether we support Hamas or not .
it is also destroying my dream to write “ Specialist in Bone Medicine ” after my name .
sometimes , I am sorry that I am from Gaza .
but my hope is still to go abroad , learn skills , and return to help others here .
sometimes , when there is electricity , I watch television and see how people live in other places .
I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel , to study , to take vacations , when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine .
we are students , not soldiers .
we are not fighters in this conflict .
why doesn ’ t Israel let us go study ?
why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds ?
soon , my fellow classmates at the medical college will be starting classes .
when they do , I will probably still be here in my father ’ s house , waiting for the blockade to end .
Bucharest : as Chile ’ s former dictator , General Augusto Pinochet , under house arrest outside of London , awaits a final decision on whether he is to be extradited to Spain to face charges of having committed crimes against humanity , Romania has tried and convicted one of its own military leaders for his role in the massacre of civilians in the city of Timisoara ten years ago .
the confused reaction to this verdict should , perhaps , give pause to all those who think that putting the past on trial is a straightforward thing .
generals Atanase Stanculescu and Mihai Chitac were found guilty of ordering the killings of dozens of innocent people in Timisoara in 1989 .
both were sentenced each to long prison terms .
the rulings were met with fierce criticism by some journalists and politicians but were enthusiastically welcomed by others .
undoubtedly , these verdicts will remain divisive in a society not yet able to come to terms with its past .
the story of General Stanculescu , sentenced to 15 years in prison , reads like a cheap novel , with treason thrown into the mix .
the tall , good-looking officer was among Nicolae Ceausescu ’ s closest aides .
as the uprising against the Ceausescu regime broke out in December 1989 in Timisoara , Stanculescu ( together with General Chitac ) was dispatched to the city and ordered to suppress all demonstrations by any available means .
he carried out these orders ruthlessly , his troops shooting down over 100 unarmed street demonstrators .
Summoned back to Bucharest two days later , Stanculescu apparently had second thoughts about his loyalty to the dictator .
he recognized that Ceausescu was doomed . pretending to have a broken leg , he stalled in making his reappearance .
then , on the 22 December , as crowds stormed the Central Committee headquarters in Bucharest , Stanculescu arranged for a helicopter to rescue Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu from the building ’ s roof terrace .
minutes before the helicopter took off , Elena told the General , who was wearing a fake plaster cast around his leg : “ Dearest Victor , look after my children ! ”
by then , however , the General had turned coats : he had joined &quot; the people &quot; and the newly-born National Salvation Front .
the helicopter was taking the dictator and his wife to prison , not freedom .
within days , Stanculescu was among those masterminding the show-trial of the Ceausescus which ended with their being sentenced to death and executed on the spot .
film of Stanculescu at the time show that he had dispensed with his plaster cast .
Stanculescu ’ s career boomed .
he was appointed industry minister by the new , revolutionary government .
a few months later , he supported a group of young officers who called for army reform and the ouster of General Militaru , the then Defense Minister and a suspected KGB agent .
Militaru was sacked , but when Stanculescu became minister he cashiered the young officers who had helped him .
reform of the army was put off .
one year later Stanculescu gave up politics and government altogether .
he set up a highly profitable arms trading company . soon he became one of the country &apos;s richest tycoons .
now , it seems that the tide has turned against him .
but has it ?
General Stanculescu has appealed to the Supreme Court to quash his conviction .
a big part of public opinion seems to be behind him , believing his trial politically motivated .
of course , many people and especially those who took to the streets against Ceausescu in 1989 feel vindicated his conviction .
but many politicians defend Stanculescu ; among them , the current Defense Minister Victor Babiuc , former President Ion Iliescu , and most top army officers .
in the wake of the Stanculescu conviction , the Interior Minister reiterated his proposal for a general amnesty for all soldiers involved in the violence of 1989 .
supporters of this view argue that General Stanculescu , unlike President Pinochet , was carrying out orders he could not refuse . later , they add , he voluntarily joined the &quot; Revolution &quot; , fought its enemies and contributed to its victory .
many Romanian Army officers are unhappy with the notion of soldiers being tried for crimes committed while defending the dying communist regime .
yet , this is what every one of Romania ’ s post-revolutionary governments have promised at one time or another .
but these officers ( and those who share their views ) believe that you cannot assess the deeds of one regime by the standards of another .
again as in Chile , they suggest that , while political regimes are transient , the heart and honor of a nation always rests with its Army . a soldier has a duty just to carry out the orders of his chiefs , no matter who they are and no matter what orders they give .
Stanculescu did just that in 1989 at Timisoara , and he did so again , a few days later , at Ceausescu ’ s trial .
these officers dismiss and mistrust the requirements of universal justice , as embodied in the Nuremberg rulings .
because democratic institutions in Romania have frittered away much of their standing during the almost ten years of postcommunist transition , many politicians tend either to embrace the views of the generals , or , at least , avoid going publicly against them .
after all , opinion polls reveal that the Army and Orthodox Church – two hierarchical and traditional organizations – are , by far , the most trusted Romanian institutions .
time and again , people seek to learn the truth about Romania ’ s past .
but , as that past becomes unearthed and its crimes exposed , many recoil from the consequences . the &quot; original sin &quot; of the Romanian Revolution always looms : most postcommunist institutions were created and later run by people deeply involved in the crimes of the communist regime .
of course , people , at first , love seeing the truth uncovered and powerful wrongdoers punished .
but many would like to see all this while watching TV rather than experience it in real life .
Romania will have to decide whether or not it actually wants to have a past before its people can begin to confront and live with theirs .
few concepts are as elastic as that of ``Conservatism . &apos; &apos;
at one end of its spectrum of meanings , conservatism has ( over the last two decades ) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civic life of greed and grab .
at the other end , conservatism in many European countries has historically veered too close for comfort to right-wing extremism .
in Germany today , conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic &apos;s failures , experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives .
this history accounts for the type of conservatism practiced by the Christian-Democratic Union ( CDU ) and Christian-Social Union ( CSU ) , who focus on moderation and balance , preservation and innovation , and on commanding Germany &apos;s political center .
with federal elections due in Germany this autumn , much will be said about the nature of German conservatism .
some , looking at CDU / CSU candidate for Chancellor Edmund Stoiber &apos;s emphasis on Bavaria &apos;s economic success , will seek to portray the coalition as shaded dangerously by the ``anything goes &apos; &apos; market conservatism practiced in America .
others , pointing to the German conservatives &apos; emphasis on social values , will say that we are as statist as the Social Democrats .
the truth itself is far more complex than these facile comparisons , which also makes it more durable .
CDU / CSU policies are , of course , founded on the idea of individual freedom , but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and the Christian tradition .
we are skeptical about unfettered individualism because of our awareness of man &apos;s sins , but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and aberrations in Germany &apos;s 20th century history .
yet , despite this deeply ingrained skepticism about human nature , we embrace humanity &apos;s talent for progress and innovation , because we recognize man &apos;s ability to correct mistakes and errors .
these two traits , although they seem to conflict , and are certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives , nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that Germany now requires .
far from being willing to coerce people to live in a certain way , German conservatives seek a politics that recognizes limits - the limits of the state , the market , and the individual .
we conceive of politics as a mechanism to reconcile enduring conflicts , such as those that exist between freedom and security .
each , indeed , is unsustainable without the other .
security is useless without freedom , but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security .
the social market economy , which we continue to embrace , is based on these principles .
it sees competition as the most effective means to promote economic growth , but also embraces state interference , when necessary , to secure equality of opportunity , social solidarity , and social balance .
this interference is also intended to help avoid the ``economization &apos; &apos; of all aspects of civic life .
the market is merely a tool , not an answer to every human problem .
it is in recognition of this fact that German conservatives strive , for example , to strike a balance between economy and ecology .
we feel responsible , on a global level , for the environment , which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world .
for globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity .
as we open ourselves to the wind &apos;s of globalization , we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity , such as the family , local and regional communities , religious communities , and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglected in recent years .
this is the principle of ``subsidiarity &apos; &apos; which supports placing decision-making power , wherever and whenever possible , in governmental bodies nearest to the individual citizen .
this is of particular importance for our ideas about the European Union , where we seek an effective balance between the nation and Europe .
for German conservatives , European integration and national identity are not warring concepts , as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others .
they are , instead , two sides of the same coin .
the EU was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation .
decades later , the European Union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constituent nations , as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations , because a common European identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a unitary constitutional structure .
in essence , the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept .
indeed , only an ongoing skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both of the statist and market fundamentalist variety - can promote pluralism and tolerance , and avoid a ballooning of the bureaucracy that enfeebles our economy .
in a fast changing world , this skepticism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike .
our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism , for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future .
moderation , tolerance , and a capacity for reform in equal measure are the watchwords of today &apos;s German conservatism .
in 2004 , the world economy grew at a rate of 5.1 % , the fastest pace in the last 28 years .
while Ifo`s World Economic Climate indicator , generated from quarterly surveys of 1,200 experts in 90 countries , worsened slightly during the first three quarters of 2005 , it rose again in the last quarter , indicating a continuation of the boom .
in 2005 , growth is estimated to have been about 4.3 % , and a similar rate can be expected in 2006 , marking a period of sustained rapid global growth unseen since the 1970 ’ s .
but the boom is not uniform .
in the United States , the number of experts giving a favorable assessment of the current situation declined ; indeed , a majority believes that the economic situation will worsen during the next six months .
however , in the Asian countries , including China , the optimism is unbroken .
the same is true for Eastern Europe , the ex-Soviet states , and Latin America .
the big surprise is Europe , which , unlike in 2004 and the first half of 2005 , now seems to be catching up with the rest of the world .
whereas growth was a miserable 1.5 % in 2005 in the 15 “ old ” members of the European Union , Ifo expects EU-15 growth to accelerate to 2.1 % in 2006 .
to be sure , economic performance will vary widely among EU countries .
while Italy will be the laggard , with only 1.1 % growth , the Irish rocket will not lose its force , pushing real GDP up by about 4.8 % .
in general , the big EU countries are still performing badly , in contrast to the smaller members – hardly surprising , given that the EU is basically an institution to help the smaller countries overcome the drawback of their size by extending the agglomeration advantages that formerly were reserved to the bigger countries .
but even Germany , Europe ’ s biggest economy , is experiencing an upswing .
the Ifo climate indicator for Germany , based on monthly surveys of 7,000 firms , jumped upwards in the second half of 2005 , reaching its highest value since the boom year 2000 , with businesses ’ assessment of the current situation and expectations improving .
after five years of stagnation , the economy is finally on the move .
the driving force is external demand , as Germany , the world ’ s second-largest exporter , profits from the global boom .
exports increased by 6.2 % in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4 % in 2006 .
however , as we saw in 2004 and 2005 , exports are not enough to create substantial growth if domestic demand does not follow .
the good news for Germany is that investment demand is now growing , too .
while the second half of 2005 was already quite good , Ifo expects investment in equipment to grow by a healthy 6 % in 2006 .
after many years of contraction , investment in construction also will rise slightly .
total investment growth is expected to reach 2.9 % – weak by past standards , but nonetheless a promising salve for the wounded German mood .
Moreover , any investment growth is vital for Germany , which , according to the latest OECD statistics , currently suffers from the world ’ s lowest share of net investment in national income .
even if Germany remains the world ’ s laggard , rising investment demand as such will contribute to GDP growth , which Ifo estimates at 1.7 % in 2006 .
that number looks small compared to most other countries .
in fact , all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster .
but everything is relative : Germany ’ s trend growth rate is just 1.1 % , and the country has been the slowest growing EU country since 1995 .
measured against a disappointing past , even Germany is currently experiencing an economic boom .
indeed , even German unemployment , which has been rising in cycles since 1970 , will decline slightly in 2006 , from 4.8 to 4.7 million .
the good economic data will reinforce initial favorable impressions of Angela Merkel ’ s new government , which got off to an excellent start at the EU Summit , where Merkel helped to broker a compromise between Britain and France on the Union ’ s 2007-2013 budget ( by adding another € 2 billion to Germany ’ s annual contribution ) .
in fact , the government may even have contributed a bit to the good economic data by announcing a serious effort to consolidate Germany ’ s own public finances – a prerequisite for investor confidence .
according to the government , substantial tax increases will bring the fiscal deficit below the 3 % -of-GDP limit set by the Stability and Growth Pact – a target missed for five consecutive years – by 2007 .
the real test for the German government is the labor market .
most observers now agree that Germany needs something like the American earned-income tax credit .
in Germany , it ’ s called “ activating social aid ” or “ combi wages , ” but the principle is the same : the state should reduce the money it pays for doing nothing and pay more for participating in the work force .
that would widen the wage distribution , create jobs , and maintain the living standard of the poor .
Merkel announced in her inaugural speech in the Bundestag that her government will introduce such a system in 2006 .
if this is more than lip service , and if she really carries out a serious reform of the German welfare state ’ s incentive structure , the result could be higher employment and structural economic growth .
in the long term , that would be more promising for the EU – and for the global economy – than the demand-driven performance that Germany is currently enjoying .
new YORK – Late next month , a child will be born – the 7th billion citizen of planet Earth . we will never know the circumstances into which he or she was born .
we do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and unpredictable change – environmental , economic , geopolitical , technological , and demographic .
the world ’ s population has tripled since the United Nations was created in 1945 .
and our numbers keep growing , with corresponding pressures on land , energy , food , and water . the global economy is generating pressures as well : rising joblessness , widening social inequalities , and the emergence of new economic powers .
these trends link the fate and future of today ’ s seven billion people as never before . no nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century . international cooperation is a universal need .
the 66th session of the UN General Assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow , short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity ’ s long-term imperatives .
at a time when all nations are experiencing individual challenges , we need to forge a worldwide common agenda that can help to ensure that the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world characterized by sustainable peace , prosperity , freedom , and justice .
to help create this future , I am focusing my second term as Secretary-General on five global imperatives – five generational opportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the decisions we make today .

the first and greatest of these imperatives is sustainable development . we all must understand that saving our planet , lifting people out of poverty , and advancing economic growth are one and the same fight . we must connect the dots between climate change , water scarcity , energy shortages , global health , food security , and women ’ s empowerment . solutions to one problem must be solutions for all .

in the next five years , we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and forge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement .
Fostering economic growth , realizing the Millennium Development Goals , and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-first century and extending it to every person on the planet .
prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity .
this year , the UN peacekeeping budget will total $ 8 billion . think of what we could save by avoiding conflicts – by deploying political mediation missions , for example , rather than troops .
we know how to do this .
our record proves it – in Guinea , Kenya , and Kyrgyzstan .
a third imperative is building a safer and more secure world . in this effort , we must be courageous in standing up for democracy , human rights , and peace .
this year was one of signature achievements in restoring and securing peace – in Côte d ’ Ivoire , Darfur , Egypt , and elsewhere . but hatred and bloodshed still stand in the way of our vision for peace .
in the Middle East , we must break the stalemate .
Palestinians deserve a state .
Israel needs security .
both want peace . a negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes , and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace .
so , too , will we continue our efforts to foster democratic governance in Iraq , Afghanistan , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and Sierra Leone . and , in the name of all of humanity , we will continue to push forward on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation , in service of realizing a world free of nuclear weapons .
the fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition .
this year ’ s dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East inspired people around the globe .
let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all .
in Libya , we are deploying a new UN support mission to assist the country ’ s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order , consistent with the aspirations of the Libyan people .
Syria is a special concern .
for six months we have seen escalating violence and repression .
the government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people .
it has not done so .
the moment to act is now .
the violence must stop .
last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people .
women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world ’ s unrealized potential .
we need their full engagement – in government , business , and civil society .
the UN has placed a high priority on promoting women at all levels of the Organization and this year , for the first time , UN Women is operating to promote the interests and rights of women all over the world .
seven billion people now look toward the United Nations for solutions to the world ’ s great global challenges .
they hold different religions and backgrounds but common dreams and aspirations .
our global future depends on bringing these individual talents and universal rights together in common cause .
let our common agenda begin .
mention the United Nations and the first reaction is likely to be the ongoing oil-for-food scandal and what it will mean for Secretary-General Kofi Annan ’ s ability to lead the organization for the remaining year and a half of his tenure .
but there is much more going on at the UN than investigations .
reform is in the air – in part because of the scandal , but also because of the UN ’ s inability to deal effectively with challenges ranging from Rwanda and Kosovo to Iraq and , most recently , Sudan .
even the UN ’ s most ardent supporters now recognize that change is called for if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security .
some of the reform talk concerns the UN Security Council ’ s composition .
the Security Council represents what the World War II Allies believed the post-war world would look like and how it should be run .
this helps to explain why a much-weakened France was made a permanent member of the Council – and why Germany and Japan ( and a not-yet independent India ) were not .
defending the Security Council ’ s current make-up is impossible ; the need for change is beyond debate .
but coming up with an approach that gains broad international support will prove extremely difficult .
great Britain and France will resist being replaced by a single EU seat , while making Germany a permanent member would only exacerbate the problem of Europe ’ s relative over-representation .
Pakistan would object to adding India to the Security Council ; Argentina , Chile , and Mexico to adding Brazil ; Nigeria to South Africa ( and vice-versa ) ; and several countries , including China , Indonesia , and South Korea , might resist creating a permanent seat for Japan .
clearly , fixing the Security Council will require considerable time and political effort .
in the meantime , there is important work to be done .
one productive avenue would be to follow up on one of the recommendations of the High Level Panel that was endorsed by Annan ; namely , that all UN members go on record declaring that terrorism has no place in today ’ s world .
this will prove more difficult than it first sounds .
for too long , the international community has tolerated terrorism – the intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants by non-state actors for political purposes – on the grounds that , on occasion , “ one man ’ s terrorist is another man ’ s freedom fighter . ”
Historians have the luxury of debating whether terrorism may have been justified in certain situations in the past .
we do not .
modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated , much less supported .
weapons of mass destruction – nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons – are just that , and no cause can excuse their use .
Moreover , as the terrorist attacks on America of 2001 showed , weapons as basic as box-cutters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulnerabilities of modern , global life .
terrorism is even less justified given that political avenues exist nowadays for pursuing political aims .
Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and can count on American , Russian , European , and UN assistance .
Iraqis have elected their own representatives and are poised to write their constitution .
no one pursuing reasonable goals and who is prepared to compromise can argue that terrorism is his or his group ’ s only option .
the world has already taken some important steps against terrorism .
a dozen international conventions and numerous UN resolutions commit governments to oppose hostage taking , the hijacking of civilian aircraft , and terrorism more broadly .
similarly , the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force , created in 1989 to curb money laundering , has grown and become focused mainly on curbing terrorist financing .
UN Security Council Resolution 1373 , passed after the September 11 attacks , calls on states to deny safe haven to terrorists , bring to justice anyone associated with terrorism , suppress recruitment by terrorist groups , block terrorists ’ efforts to acquire weapons , and cooperate with other governments and international organizations in tracking suspects and boosting security .
what is missing is a new , 13th convention that closes the loophole that seems to permit governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not .
broad agreement is needed that any intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants is unacceptable , and that its perpetrators and supporters must be punished .
of course , such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism .
but ideas matter .
terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been .
doing so will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism ; it should also make it less difficult to garner support for international action against those who nevertheless carry it out .
we are taught early on in our lives that the end cannot justify the means .
it is time to put this principle into effect before many more innocent lives are lost .
Nairobi – With unemployment soaring , bankruptcies climbing , and stock markets in free-fall , it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold .
but this would be a devastating mistake of immediate , as well as inter-generational , proportions .
far from burdening an already over-stressed , over-stretched global economy , environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work , get order books flowing , and assist in powering economies back to health .
in the past , concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury ; today , it is a necessity – a point grasped by some , but by no means all , economic architects yet .
a big slice of President Barack Obama ’ s $ 825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy , “ weatherizing ” a million homes , and upgrading the country ’ s inefficient electricity grid .
such investments could generate an estimated five million “ green-collar ” jobs , provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries , and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security .
the Republic of Korea , which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years , has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times .
President Lee Myung-Bak ’ s government plans to invest $ 38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities .
other elements of Lee ’ s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks , such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks , and generating energy using waste methane from landfills .
the package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies .
similar pro-employment “ Green New Deal ” packages have been lined up in China , Japan , and the United Kingdom .
they are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs , fighting poverty , and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports .
in South Africa , the government-backedWorking for Water initiative – which employs more than 30,000 people , including women , youth , and the disabled – also sees opportunity in crisis .
the country spends roughly $ 60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife , water supplies , important tourism destinations , and farmland .
this work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel .
as a result , an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity , equal to 2 % of the country ’ s electricity needs , will be generated , along with more than 5,000 jobs .
so it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure , energy systems , and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery .
others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80 % of Africans who have no access to electricity .
still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit .
in early February , the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world ’ s leading economists at the UN ’ s headquarters in New York .
a strategy for a Global Green New Deal , tailored to different national challenges , will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts .
the Global Green New Deal , which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008 , responds to the current economic malaise .
spent wisely , however , these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends , setting the stage for a more sustainable , urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century .
the trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes , together with the trillions of investors ’ dollars waiting in the wings , represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago : the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss .
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children ’ s future .
instead , political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation , promote sustainable businesses , and encourage new patterns of decent , long-lasting employment .
Cambridge : the rich countries meeting in June at the G-7 Economic Summit in Cologne had some interesting things to declare about their relations with the poor countries .
first , they acknowledged -- without ever quite admitting it -- that their earlier attempts to reduce developing-country debt had failed .
therefore they signaled the start of a new program , immediately dubbed the Cologne Initiative , to reduce further the debt burden of the so-called Highly Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPCs ) .
second , they instructed the IMF and the World Bank to re-think their development strategies , in order to put more focus on social problems , particularly health and education .
one could of course be quite cynical about both announcements .
after all , it has been clear to most objective observers for many years that the rich countries had no realistic strategy for reducing the unpayable debts of the poor countries , yet such critics were told to be patient , that everything was okay .
Moreover , only the finance ministers of the G-7 could possibly have believed that the IMF and World Bank were doing a good job in the poorest countries .
in truth , their record is often disastrous , or simply irrelevant .
the IMF in particular doesn &apos;t have a strategy for long-term economic development , even though the United States has assigned the IMF the lead role in economic development in dozens of poor countries .
another reason for cynicism is that the G-7 didn &apos;t move mainly on their own initiative , but rather in response to a growing cry of international civil society for action on behalf of the world &apos;s poorest .
the credit for the Cologne Initiative goes strongly to the worldwide movement known as Jubilee 2000 , a grass-roots movement based on the biblical concept of Jubilee , in which unpayable debts should be forgiven in order to allow a debtor to have a fresh start in life .
the Jubilee 2000 movement has adherents in all parts of the world , including Pope John Paul II , rock stars such as Bono of the Irish group U2 , and non-governmental organizations representing many religions and professions .
we should move beyond cynicism , however , in embracing the new Cologne Initiative , especially to push the G-7 countries to do all that needs to be done to make the Initiative successful .
the details of the Initiative announced in Cologne were disappointing , but these details can still be changed under international public pressure .
at least the Initiative pointed in the right direction .
the motivation for urgent action on behalf of the poorest nations is clear .
the 42 countries that are part of the HIPC initiative have a combined population of around 700 million .
around three-fourths of these people live in Africa .
the combined HIPC population has a life expectancy of around 50 years , compared with 78 years in the rich countries .
around one-third of the children are malnourished , and will consequently suffer a lifetime of physical and cognitive disabilities .
many will never finish even primary school , or be able to play an effective role in modern society .
diseases are rampant , including an AIDs epidemic that killed around 2 million people in Africa last year , and malaria , which took more than 1 million lives .
a successful Cologne Initiative would build on the following concepts .
first , the debts of the countries suffering from extreme poverty and illness would be forgiven entirely .
around 25 countries out of the 42 HIPC countries probably need complete debt cancellation .
second , the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , rather than the International Monetary Fund , should take the lead in helping these countries .
both the UNDP and the World Bank would help to ensure that debt forgiveness opens the way to new and ambitious programs of social improvement -- with the focuses on health and education .
the UNDP should turn its annual Human Development Reports into concrete guidelines for social action , to help ensure that each impoverished country has the adequate resources to provide effective programs for children &apos;s vaccines , AIDS prevention , meals for impoverished children , improved access to clean water , and mother-and-infant medical care .
the UNDP should also have the task of coordinating the specialized agencies of the United Nations on behalf of the world &apos;s poorest , to ensure that key organizations such as United Nations Children &apos;s Fund ( UNICEF ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) have the access and financial resources to fulfill their missions .
the Cologne Summit announcements so far fall short of these objectives .
the debt relief proposals are still too small .
the role of the IMF remains too large .
public health goals are still too far down the list of priorities .
but we should maintain hope and pressure on the international organizations and the rich countries .
already , international actions have pushed the G-7 in a new and hopeful direction .
with a continued worldwide movement on behalf of global justice and economic development , a much more ambitious program for the world &apos;s poorest can still be reached .
two wrongs don ’ t make a right .
just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents ’ tables doesn ’ t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone .
that may sound obvious , but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating .
for example , Italian politicians , who , given Italy ’ s recent dismal economic performance , would seem the least qualified to offer the ECB advice on monetary policy , are nonetheless advocating interest-rate cuts .
echoing comments by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , Deputy Economics Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in vain “ if someone is pushing on the brake pedal . ”
who ’ s he kidding ?
if anyone is “ pushing down on the Italian growth brake ” it is Berlusconi himself .
he has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy ’ s lame economic performance .
but it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy .
more than the usual “ blame game ” is at work here .
pressures are mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates – and Berlusconi and Co . ’ s attacks are as much as an attempt to forestall future rate hikes as to get the ECB to loosen its monetary policy .
soaring energy prices , for example , have become a leading inflation risk .
but higher energy prices , by themselves , will not cause the ECB to pull the interest-rate trigger .
the key will be so-called “ second-round effects ” – whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions .
so far , the “ social partners , ” as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions , have been quiet .
should this change , the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe ’ s economic growth remains slack .
the good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up ( even in Italy ) .
though second-quarter GDP growth was weak — the euro-zone average was only 0.3 % year on year – third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year .
only consumption is lagging .
how will the ECB react to better economic news ?
some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low , at 2 % , for so long ( more than two years ) .
true , there is no inflation problem in the short run , but the ECB ’ s monetary policy focuses on the medium term .
one particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB ’ s benchmark level , indicating an excess supply of liquidity .
it is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question .
slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the ECB ’ s Governing Council .
this will change , however , once the economic pick-up is confirmed .
interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later , which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now .
meanwhile , in Germany , the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy .
Angela Merkel , the Christian Democrats ’ candidate , is a reformer , holding out hope for Germany ’ s future – and that of Europe .
unfortunately , Merkel ’ s campaign is off to a rocky start , and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine ’ s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats .
this would be bad news for the German economy , which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes .
because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely , companies might hold off on investment , while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed , because official policy would be even less clear than it is now .
on the other hand , a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action .
this raises an interesting point .
the public should be relieved if the ECB raises rates , because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well under way , and that inflationary repercussions are being addressed .
a hike , in other words , would indicate that good things are happening .
but the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth .
Blame-game politicians like Berlusconi , who have failed to put bread on the table , their minions in the media , and Keynesian economic professors who don ’ t understand and misrepresent Keynes sustain this distorted view .
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth .
the specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike , but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
the America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie .
